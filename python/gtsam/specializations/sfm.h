 * NOTES
 * =================
 *
 * `py::bind_vector` and similar machinery gives the std container a Python-like
 * interface, but without the `<pybind11/stl.h>` copying mechanism. Combined
 * with `PYBIND11_MAKE_OPAQUE` this allows the types to be modified with Python,
 * and saves one copy operation.
