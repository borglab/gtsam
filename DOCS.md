## Wrap Module Definition

### Important

The python wrapper supports keyword arguments for functions/methods. Hence, the argument names matter. An implementation restriction is that in overloaded methods or functions, arguments of different types *have* to have different names.

### Requirements

- Classes must start with an uppercase letter.
    - The wrapper can wrap a typedef, e.g. `typedef TemplatedClass<Arg> EasyName;`.

- Only one Method/Constructor per line, though methods/constructors can extend across multiple lines.

- Methods can return
    - Eigen types: `Matrix`, `Vector`.
    - C/C++ basic types: `string`, `bool`, `size_t`, `int`, `double`, `char`, `unsigned char`.
    - `void`
    - Any class with which be copied with `boost::make_shared()`.
    - `boost::shared_ptr` of any object type.

- Constructors
    - Overloads are supported, but arguments of different types *have* to have different names.
    - A class with no constructors can be returned from other functions but not allocated directly in MATLAB.

- Methods
    - Constness has no effect.
    - Specify by-value (not reference) return types, even if C++ method returns reference.
    - Must start with a letter (upper or lowercase).
    - Overloads are supported.

- Static methods
    - Must start with a letter (upper or lowercase) and use the "static" keyword, e.g. `static void func()`.
    - The first letter will be made uppercase in the generated MATLAB interface.
    - Overloads are supported, but arguments of different types *have* to have different names.

- Arguments to functions can be any of
    - Eigen types: `Matrix`, `Vector`.
    - Eigen types and classes as an optionally const reference.
    - C/C++ basic types: `string`, `bool`, `size_t`, `size_t`, `double`, `char`, `unsigned char`.
    - Any class with which be copied with `boost::make_shared()` (except Eigen).
    - `boost::shared_ptr` of any object type (except Eigen).

- Properties or Variables
    - You can specify class variables in the interface file as long as they are in the `public` scope, e.g.

    ```cpp
    class Sample {
        double seed;
    };
    ```

    - Class variables are read-write so they can be updated directly in Python.

- Operator Overloading (Python only)
    - You can overload operators just like in C++.

    ```cpp
    class Overload {
        Overload operator*(const Overload& other) const;
    };
    ```
    - Supported operators are the intersection of those supported in C++ and in Python.
    - Operator overloading definitions have to be marked as `const` methods.

- Pointer types
    - To declare a simple/raw pointer, simply add an `@` to the class name, e.g.`Pose3@`.
    - To declare a shared pointer (e.g. `gtsam::noiseModel::Base::shared_ptr`), use an asterisk (i.e. `*`). E.g. `gtsam::noiseModel::Base*` to define the wrapping for the `Base` noise model shared pointer.

- Comments can use either C++ or C style, with multiple lines.

- Namespace definitions
    - Names of namespaces must start with a lowercase letter.
    - Start a namespace with `namespace example_ns {`, where `example_ns` is the namespace name.
    - End a namespace with exactly `}`
    - Namespaces can be nested.

- Namespace usage
     - Namespaces can be specified for classes in arguments and return values.
     - In each case, the namespace must be fully specified, e.g., `namespace1::namespace2::ClassName`.

- Includes in C++ wrappers
    - All includes will be collected and added in a single file.
    - All namespaces must have angle brackets, e.g. `#include <path>`.
    - No default includes will be added.

- Global/Namespace functions
    - Functions specified outside of a class are **global**.
    - Can be overloaded with different arguments.
    - Can have multiple functions of the same name in different namespaces.
    - Functions can be templated and have multiple template arguments, e.g.
        ```cpp
        template<T, R, S>
        ```
- Global variables
    - Similar to global functions, the wrapper supports global variables as well.
    - Currently we only support primitive types, such as `double`, `int`, `string`, etc.
    - E.g.
        ```cpp
        const double kGravity = -9.81;
        ```

- Using classes defined in other modules
    - If you are using a class `OtherClass` not wrapped in an interface file, add `class OtherClass;` as a forward declaration to avoid a dependency error.
    - `OtherClass` may not be in the same project. If this is the case, include the header for the appropriate project `#include <other_project/OtherClass.h>`.

- Virtual inheritance
    - Specify fully-qualified base classes, i.e. `virtual class Derived : ns::Base {` where `ns` is the namespace.
    - Mark with `virtual` keyword, e.g. `virtual class Base {`, and also `virtual class Derived : ns::Base {`.
    - Base classes can be templated, e.g. `virtual class Dog: ns::Animal<Pet> {};`. This is useful when you want to inherit from specialized classes.
    - Forward declarations must also be marked virtual, e.g. `virtual class ns::Base;` and
      also `virtual class ns::Derived;`.
    - Pure virtual (abstract) classes should list no constructors in the interface file.
    - Virtual classes must have a `clone()` function in C++ (though it does not have to be included
      in the interface file). `clone()` will be called whenever an object copy is needed, instead
      of using the copy constructor (which is used for non-virtual objects).
    - Signature of clone function - `clone()` will be called virtually, so must appear at least at the top of the inheritance tree

        ```cpp
        virtual boost::shared_ptr<CLASS_NAME> clone() const;
        ```

- Templates
    - Basic templates are supported either with an explicit list of types to instantiate,
      e.g.

      ```cpp
      template<T = {gtsam::Pose2, gtsam::Rot2, gtsam::Point3}> class Class1 { ... };
      ```

      or with typedefs, e.g.

      ```cpp
      template<T, U> class Class2 { ... };
      typedef Class2<Type1, Type2> MyInstantiatedClass;
      ```
    - Templates can also be defined for methods, properties and static methods.
    - In the class definition, appearances of the template argument(s) will be replaced with their
      instantiated types, e.g. `void setValue(const T& value);`.
    - To refer to the instantiation of the template class itself, use `This`, i.e. `static This Create();`.
    - To create new instantiations in other modules, you must copy-and-paste the whole class definition
      into the new module, but use only your new instantiation types.
    - When forward-declaring template instantiations, use the generated/typedef'd name, e.g.

      ```cpp
      class gtsam::Class1Pose2;
      class gtsam::MyInstantiatedClass;
      ```
    - Template arguments can be templates themselves, e.g.

      ```cpp
      // Typedef'd PinholeCamera
      template<CALIBRATION>
      class PinholeCamera { ... };
      typedef gtsam::PinholeCamera<gtsam::Cal3_S2> PinholeCameraCal3_S2;

      template<CAMERA>
      class SfmFactor { ... };
      // This is valid.
      typedef gtsam::SfmFactor<gtsam::PinholeCamera<gtsam::Cal3_S2>> BasicSfmFactor;
      ```

- `Boost.serialization` within the wrapper:
    - You need to mark classes as being serializable in the markup file (see `gtsam.i` for examples).
    - There are two options currently, depending on the class.  To "mark" a class as serializable,
      add a function with a particular signature so that `wrap` will catch it.
       - Add `void serialize()` to a class to create serialization functions for a class.
         Adding this flag subsumes the `serializable()` flag below.
         
         Requirements:
            - A default constructor must be publicly accessible.
            - Must not be an abstract base class.
            - The class must have an actual boost.serialization `serialize()` function.

       - Add `void serializable()` to a class if you only want the class to be serialized as a
         part of a container (such as `noiseModel`). This version does not require a publicly
         accessible default constructor.

- Forward declarations and class definitions for **Pybind**:
    - Need to specify the base class (both this forward class and base class are declared in an external Pybind header)
    - This is so that Pybind can generate proper inheritance.

    - Example for when wrapping a gtsam-based project:

        ```cpp
         // forward declarations
         virtual class gtsam::NonlinearFactor
         virtual class gtsam::NoiseModelFactor : gtsam::NonlinearFactor
         // class definition
         #include <MyFactor.h>
         virtual class MyFactor : gtsam::NoiseModelFactor {...};
         ```

   - **DO NOT** re-define an overriden function already declared in the external (forward-declared) base class. This will cause an ambiguity problem in the Pybind header file.

- Splitting wrapper over multiple files
    - The Pybind11 wrapper supports splitting the wrapping code over multiple files.
    - To be able to use classes from another module, simply import the C++ header file in that wrapper file.
    - Unfortunately, this means that aliases can no longer be used.
    - Similarly, there can be multiple `preamble.h` and `specializations.h` files. Each of these should match the module file name.

### TODO
- Handle `gtsam::Rot3M` conversions to quaternions.
- Parse return of const ref arguments.
- Parse `std::string` variants and convert directly to special string.
- Add generalized serialization support via `boost.serialization` with hooks to MATLAB save/load.
