GTSAM
======

GTSAM 4.0 is a BSD-licensed C++ library that implements sensor fusion for
robotics and computer vision applications, including
SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), VO (Visual Odometry),
and SFM (Structure from Motion).
It uses factor graphs and Bayes networks as the underlying computing paradigm
rather than sparse matrices to optimize for the most probable configuration
or an optimal plan.
Coupled with a capable sensor front-end (not provided here), GTSAM powers
many impressive autonomous systems, in both academia and industry.
