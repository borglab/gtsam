  /**
   * This is the base class for all factor types, as well as conditionals, 
   * which are implemented as specialized factors.  This class does not store any
   * data other than its keys.  Derived classes store data such as matrices and
   * probability tables.
   *
   * The `error` method is used to evaluate the factor, and is the only method
   * that is required to be implemented in derived classes, although it has a 
   * default implementation that throws an exception.
   * 
   * There are five broad classes of factors that derive from Factor:
   *
   * - \b Nonlinear factors, such as \class NonlinearFactor and \class NoiseModelFactor, which
   *   represent a nonlinear likelihood function over a set of variables.
   * - \b Gaussian factors, such as \class JacobianFactor and \class HessianFactor, which
   *   represent a Gaussian likelihood over a set of variables.
   * - \b Discrete factors, such as \class DiscreteFactor and \class DecisionTreeFactor, which
   *   represent a discrete distribution over a set of variables.
   * - \b Hybrid factors, such as \class HybridFactor, which represent a mixture of
   *   Gaussian and discrete distributions over a set of variables.
   * - \b Symbolic factors, used to represent a graph structure, such as
   *   \class SymbolicFactor, only used for symbolic elimination etc.
   *
   * Note that derived classes must also redefine the `This` and `shared_ptr`
   * typedefs. See JacobianFactor, etc. for examples.
