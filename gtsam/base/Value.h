     * There are two important things that users need to do to serialize derived objects in Values successfully:
     * (Those derived objects are stored in Values as pointer to this abstract base class Value)
     *
     *     1. All DERIVED classes derived from Value must put the following line in their serialization function:
     *       \code
                ar & boost::serialization::make_nvp("DERIVED", boost::serialization::base_object<Value>(*this));
            \endcode
     *       or, alternatively
     *       \code
                ar & BOOST_SERIALIZATION_BASE_OBJECT_NVP(Value);
            \endcode
     *       See: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/serialization/doc/serialization.html#runtimecasting
     *
     *     2. The source module that includes archive class headers to serialize objects of derived classes
     *      (boost/archive/text_oarchive.h, for example) must *export* all derived classes, using either
     *      BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT or BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT_GUID macros:
                 \code
                BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT(DERIVED_CLASS_1)
                BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT_GUID(DERIVED_CLASS_2, "DERIVED_CLASS_2_ID_STRING")
                 \endcode
     *       See:   http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/serialization/doc/serialization.html#derivedpointers
     *             http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/serialization/doc/serialization.html#export
     *             http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/serialization/doc/serialization.html#instantiation\
     *             http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/serialization/doc/special.html#export
     *             http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/libs/serialization/doc/traits.html#export
     *       The last two links explain why these export lines have to be in the same source module that includes
     *       any of the archive class headers.
