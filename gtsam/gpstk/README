/** @mainpage
 * This documentation describes the architecture and design of the
 * GPS ToolKit (GPSTk), produced by the Space and Geophysics Laboratory (SGL)
 * of Applied Research Laboratories, The University of Texas at Austin (ARL:UT).
 *
 * This documentation is generated nightly from the GPSTk Subversion repository.
 *
 * \section intro Introduction
 * GPSTK is a library of support routines designed for use by programmers
 * developing applications that read and write (particularly in RINEX format),
 * process and otherwise manipulate GPS data. It is characterized by the following:
 * - Modern, ANSI C++; highly object oriented
 * - Uses templates, the Standard Template Library (STL) and iostreams classes
 * - Portable and platform independent
 * - Includes full implementation of the RINEX (Receiver Independent Exchange Format) I/O
 *
 * \section codedesign Code Design
 * \subsection namesp Namespaces
 * All GPSTK code is placed within the gpstk namespace. Within the gpstk namespace, other
 * namespaces are defined for certain specialized functionality; these include
 * - gpstk::BinUtils in the Binary utilities module
 * - gpstk::FileUtils in the File utilities module
 * - gpstk::StringUtils in the String utilities module
 *
 * Namespace std is also used throughout the GPSTK.
 *
 * \section content Library Content
 * The library consists of several modules, which are more or less dependent upon each
 * other. These include
 * - Exceptions for use throughout the library
 * - Binary utilities
 * - STL "helpers"
 * - String utilities
 * - Command line options
 * - Date and time conversions
 * - Formatted file I/O
 * - File utilities, including file filters and filter hunter
 * - Vector and Matrix algorithms
 * - Mathematical algorithms
 * - Geodetic coordinates, conversions, etc
 * - Complete RINEX implementation (including Glonass and other data),
 *    with extensions that allow user-defined observation types
 *   -# Rinex Meterological file I/O
 *   -# Rinex Navigation file I/O
 *   -# Rinex Observation file I/O
 * - Ephemeris calculations, including almanac and ICD-GPS-200 algorithms
 * - Ephemeris I/O and storage
 * - SP3 format file ("precise ephemeris") I/O and storage
 * - GPS navigation solution algorithms
 * - Basic application frameworks
 * - P-Code generator
 * - GNSS Data Structures handling
 *
 * \section applic Applications
 * This distribution also includes several stand-alone application programs which
 * also serve as examples of how to use the GPSTK. These include
 * - Rinex summary
 * - Rinex editor
 * - Discontinuity Correction (i.e. cycle slip fixing)
 * - Residual and correction generator
