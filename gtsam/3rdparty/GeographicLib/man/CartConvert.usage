"       CartConvert [ -r ] [ -l lat0 lon0 h0 ] [ -e a f ] [ -w ] [ -p prec ] [\n"

"DESCRIPTION\n"
"       Convert geodetic coordinates to either geocentric or local cartesian\n"
"       coordinates.  Geocentric coordinates have the origin at the center of\n"
"       the earth, with the z axis going thru the north pole, and the x axis\n"
"       thru latitude = 0, longitude = 0.  By default, the conversion is to\n"
"       geocentric coordinates.  Specifying -l lat0 lon0 h0 causes a local\n"
"       coordinate system to be used with the origin at latitude = lat0,\n"
"       longitude = lon0, height = h0, z normal to the ellipsoid and y due\n"
"       north.\n"
"\n"
"       Geodetic coordinates are provided on standard input as a set of lines\n"
"       containing (blank separated) latitude, longitude (decimal degrees or\n"
"       degrees, minutes and seconds), and height above the ellipsoid (meters);\n"
"       for details on the allowed formats for latitude and longitude, see the\n"
"       \"GEOGRAPHIC COORDINATES\" section of GeoConvert(1).  For each set of\n"
"       geodetic coordinates, the corresponding cartesian coordinates x, y, z\n"
"       (meters) are printed on standard output.\n"
"\n"
"OPTIONS\n"
"       -r  perform the reverse projection.  x, y, z are given on standard\n"
"           input and each line of standard output gives latitude, longitude,\n"
"           height.\n"
"\n"
"       -l lat0 lon0 h0\n"
"           specifies conversions to and from a local cartesion coordinate\n"
"           systems with origin lat0 lon0 h0, instead of a geocentric\n"
"           coordinate system.  The -w flag can be used to swap the default\n"
"           order of the 2 geographic coordinates, provided that it appears\n"
"           before -l.\n"
"\n"
"       -e a f\n"
"           specify the ellipsoid via the equatorial radius, a and the\n"
"           flattening, f.  Setting f = 0 results in a sphere.  Specify f < 0\n"
"           for a prolate ellipsoid.  A simple fraction, e.g., 1/297, is\n"
"           allowed for f.  By default, the WGS84 ellipsoid is used, a =\n"
"           6378137 m, f = 1/298.257223563.\n"
"\n"
"       -w  toggle the longitude first flag (it starts off); if the flag is on,\n"
"           then on input and output, longitude precedes latitude (except that,\n"
"           on input, this can be overridden by a hemisphere designator, N, S,\n"
"           E, W).\n"
"\n"
"       -p prec\n"
"           set the output precision to prec (default 6).  prec is the number\n"
"           of digits after the decimal point for geocentric and local\n"
"           cartesion coordinates and for the height (in meters).  For\n"
"           latitudes and longitudes (in degrees), the number of digits after\n"
"           the decimal point is prec + 5.\n"
"\n"
"       --comment-delimiter commentdelim\n"
"           set the comment delimiter to commentdelim (e.g., \"#\" or \"//\").  If\n"
"           set, the input lines will be scanned for this delimiter and, if\n"
"           found, the delimiter and the rest of the line will be removed prior\n"
"           to processing and subsequently appended to the output line\n"
"           (separated by a space).\n"
"\n"
"       --version\n"
"           print version and exit.\n"
"\n"
"       -h  print usage and exit.\n"
"\n"
"       --help\n"
"           print full documentation and exit.\n"
"\n"
"       --input-file infile\n"
"           read input from the file infile instead of from standard input; a\n"
"           file name of \"-\" stands for standard input.\n"
"\n"
"       --input-string instring\n"
"           read input from the string instring instead of from standard input.\n"
"           All occurrences of the line separator character (default is a\n"
"           semicolon) in instring are converted to newlines before the reading\n"
"           begins.\n"
"\n"
"       --line-separator linesep\n"
"           set the line separator character to linesep.  By default this is a\n"
"           semicolon.\n"
"\n"
"       --output-file outfile\n"
"           write output to the file outfile instead of to standard output; a\n"
"           file name of \"-\" stands for standard output.\n"

"ERRORS\n"
"       An illegal line of input will print an error message to standard output\n"
"       beginning with \"ERROR:\" and causes CartConvert to return an exit code\n"
