"DESCRIPTION\n"
"       GeoConvert reads from standard input interpreting each line as a\n"
"       geographic coordinate and prints the coordinate in the format specified\n"
"       by the options on standard output.  The input is interpreted in one of\n"
"       three different ways depending on how many space or comma delimited\n"
"       tokens there are on the line.  The options -g, -d, -u, and -m govern\n"
"       the format of output.  In all cases, the WGS84 model of the earth is\n"
"       used (a = 6378137 m, f = 1/298.257223563).\n"
"\n"
"       geographic\n"
"           2 tokens (output options -g, -d, or -:) given as latitude longitude\n"
"           using decimal degrees or degrees, minutes, and seconds.  Latitude\n"
"           is given first (unless the -w option is given).  See \"GEOGRAPHIC\n"
"           COORDINATES\" for a description of the format.  For example, the\n"
"           following are all equivalent\n"
"\n"
"               33.3 44.4\n"
"               E44.4 N33.3\n"

"\n"
"       UTM/UPS\n"
"           3 tokens (output option -u) given as zone+hemisphere easting\n"
"           northing or easting northing zone+hemisphere, where hemisphere is\n"
"           either n (or north) or s (or south).  The zone is absent for a UPS\n"
"           specification.  For example,\n"
"\n"
"               38n 444140.54 3684706.36\n"

"\n"
"       MRGS\n"
"           1 token (output option -m) is used to specify the center of an MGRS\n"
"           grid square.  For example,\n"
"\n"
"               38SMB4484\n"
"               38SMB44140847064\n"
"\n"
"OPTIONS\n"
"       -g  output latitude and longitude using decimal degrees.  Default\n"
"           output mode.\n"
"\n"
"       -d  output latitude and longitude using degrees, minutes, and seconds\n"
"           (DMS).\n"
"\n"
"       -:  like -d, except use : as a separator instead of the d, ', and \"\n"
"           delimiters.\n"
"\n"
"       -u  output UTM or UPS.\n"
"\n"
"       -m  output MGRS.\n"
"\n"
"       -c  output meridian convergence and scale for the corresponding UTM or\n"
"           UPS projection.  The meridian convergence is the bearing of grid\n"
"           north given as degrees clockwise from true north.\n"
"\n"
"       -z zone\n"
"           set the zone to zone for output.  Use either 0 < zone <= 60 for a\n"
"           UTM zone or zone = 0 for UPS.  Alternatively use a zone+hemisphere\n"
"           designation, e.g., 38n.  See \"ZONE\".\n"
"\n"
"       -s  use the standard UPS and UTM zones.\n"
"\n"
"       -t  similar to -s but forces UPS regions to the closest UTM zone.\n"
"\n"
"       -S or -T\n"
"           behave the same as -s and -t, respectively, until the first legal\n"
"           conversion is performed.  For subsequent points, the zone and\n"
"           hemisphere of that conversion are used.  This enables a sequence of\n"
"           points to be converted into UTM or UPS using a consistent\n"
"           coordinate system.\n"
"\n"
"       -n  on input, MGRS coordinates refer to the south-west corner of the\n"
"           MGRS square instead of the center; see \"MGRS\".\n"
"\n"
"       -w  toggle the longitude first flag (it starts off); if the flag is on,\n"
"           then on input and output, longitude precedes latitude (except that,\n"
"           on input, this can be overridden by a hemisphere designator, N, S,\n"
"           E, W).\n"
"\n"
"       -p prec\n"
"           set the output precision to prec (default 0); prec is the precision\n"
"           relative to 1 m.  See \"PRECISION\".\n"
"\n"
"       -l  on output, UTM/UPS uses the long forms north and south to designate\n"
"           the hemisphere instead of n or s.\n"
"\n"
"       -a  on output, UTM/UPS uses the abbreviations n and s to designate the\n"
"           hemisphere instead of north or south; this is the default\n"
"           representation.\n"
"\n"
"       --comment-delimiter commentdelim\n"
"           set the comment delimiter to commentdelim (e.g., \"#\" or \"//\").  If\n"
"           set, the input lines will be scanned for this delimiter and, if\n"
"           found, the delimiter and the rest of the line will be removed prior\n"
"           to processing and subsequently appended to the output line\n"
"           (separated by a space).\n"
"\n"
"       --version\n"
"           print version and exit.\n"
"\n"
"       -h  print usage and exit.\n"
"\n"
"       --help\n"
"           print full documentation and exit.\n"
"\n"
"       --input-file infile\n"
"           read input from the file infile instead of from standard input; a\n"
"           file name of \"-\" stands for standard input.\n"
"\n"
"       --input-string instring\n"
"           read input from the string instring instead of from standard input.\n"
"           All occurrences of the line separator character (default is a\n"
"           semicolon) in instring are converted to newlines before the reading\n"
"           begins.\n"
"\n"
"       --line-separator linesep\n"
"           set the line separator character to linesep.  By default this is a\n"
"           semicolon.\n"
"\n"
"       --output-file outfile\n"
"           write output to the file outfile instead of to standard output; a\n"
"           file name of \"-\" stands for standard output.\n"
"\n"
"PRECISION\n"
"       prec gives precision of the output with prec = 0 giving 1 m precision,\n"
"       prec = 3 giving 1 mm precision, etc.  prec is the number of digits\n"
"       after the decimal point for UTM/UPS.  For MGRS, The number of digits\n"
"       per coordinate is 5 + prec; <prec> = -6 results in just the grid zone.\n"
"       For decimal degrees, the number of digits after the decimal point is 5\n"
"       + prec.  For DMS (degree, minute, seconds) output, the number of digits\n"
"       after the decimal point in the seconds components is 1 + prec; if this\n"
"       is negative then use minutes (prec = -2 or -3) or degrees (prec <= -4)\n"
"       as the least significant component.  Print convergence, resp. scale,\n"
"       with 5 + prec, resp. 7 + prec, digits after the decimal point.  The\n"
"       minimum value of prec is -5 (-6 for MGRS) and the maximum is 9 for\n"
"       UTM/UPS, 9 for decimal degrees, 10 for DMS, 6 for MGRS, and 8 for\n"
"       convergence and scale.\n"
"\n"
"GEOGRAPHIC COORDINATES\n"
"       The utility accepts geographic coordinates, latitude and longitude, in\n"
"       a number of common formats.  Latitude precedes longitude, unless the -w\n"
"       option is given which switches this convention.  On input, either\n"
"       coordinate may be given first by appending or prepending N or S to the\n"
"       latitude and E or W to the longitude.  These hemisphere designators\n"
"       carry an implied sign, positive for N and E and negative for S and W.\n"
"       This sign multiplies any +/- sign prefixing the coordinate.  The\n"
"       coordinates may be given as decimal degree or as degrees, minutes, and\n"
"       seconds.  d, ', and \" are used to denote degrees, minutes, and seconds,\n"
"       with the least significant designator optional.  (See \"QUOTING\" for how\n"
"       to quote the characters ' and \" when entering coordinates on the\n"
"       command line.)  Alternatively, : (colon) may be used to separate the\n"
"       various components.  Only the final component of coordinate can include\n"
"       a decimal point, and the minutes and seconds components must be less\n"
"       than 60.\n"
"\n"
"       It is also possible to carry out addition or subtraction operations in\n"
"       geographic coordinates.  If the coordinate includes interior signs\n"
"       (i.e., not at the beginning or immediately after an initial hemisphere\n"
"       designator), then the coordinate is split before such signs; the pieces\n"
"       are parsed separately and the results summed.  For example the point\n"
"       15\" east of 39N 70W is\n"
"\n"
"           39N 70W+0:0:15E\n"
"\n"
"       WARNING: \"Exponential\" notation is not recognized for geographic\n"
"       coordinates.  Thus 7.0E1 is illegal, while 7.0E+1 is parsed as (7.0E) +\n"
"       (+1), yielding the same result as 8.0E.\n"
"\n"
"       Various unicode characters (encoded with UTF-8) may also be used to\n"
"       denote degrees, minutes, and seconds, e.g., the degree, prime, and\n"
"       double prime symbols; in addition two single quotes can be used to\n"
"       represent \".\n"
"\n"
"       The other GeographicLib utilities use the same rules for interpreting\n"
"       geographic coordinates; in addition, azimuths and arc lengths are\n"
"       interpreted the same way.\n"
"\n"
"QUOTING\n"
"       Unfortunately the characters ' and \" have special meanings in many\n"
"       shells and have to be entered with care.  However note (1) that the\n"
"       trailing designator is optional and that (2) you can use colons as a\n"
"       separator character.  Thus 10d20' can be entered as 10d20 or 10:20 and\n"
"       10d20'30\" can be entered as 10:20:30.\n"
"\n"
"       Unix shells (sh, bash, tsch)\n"
"           The characters ' and \" can be quoted by preceding them with a \\\n"
"           (backslash); or you can quote a string containing ' with a pair of\n"
"           \"s.  The two alternatives are illustrated by\n"
"\n"
"              echo 10d20\\'30\\\" \"20d30'40\" | GeoConvert -d -p -1\n"
"              => 10d20'30\"N 020d30'40\"E\n"
"\n"
"           Quoting of command line arguments is similar\n"
"\n"
"              GeoConvert -d -p -1 --input-string \"10d20'30\\\" 20d30'40\"\n"
"              => 10d20'30\"N 020d30'40\"E\n"
"\n"
"       Windows command shell (cmd)\n"
"           The ' character needs no quoting; the \" character can either be\n"
"           quoted by a ^ or can be represented by typing ' twice.  (This\n"
"           quoting is usually unnecessary because the trailing designator can\n"
"           be omitted.)  Thus\n"
"\n"
"              echo 10d20'30'' 20d30'40 | GeoConvert -d -p -1\n"
"              => 10d20'30\"N 020d30'40\"E\n"
"\n"
"           Use \\ to quote the \" character in a command line argument\n"
"\n"
"              GeoConvert -d -p -1 --input-string \"10d20'30\\\" 20d30'40\"\n"
"              => 10d20'30\"N 020d30'40\"E\n"
"\n"
"       Input from a file\n"
"           No quoting need be done if the input from a file.  Thus each line\n"
"           of the file \"input.txt\" should just contain the plain coordinates.\n"
"\n"
"             GeoConvert -d -p -1 < input.txt\n"
"\n"
"MGRS\n"
"       MGRS coordinates represent a square patch of the earth, thus\n"
"       \"38SMB4488\" is in zone \"38n\" with 444km <= easting < 445km and 3688km\n"
"       <= northing < 3689km.  Consistent with this representation, coordinates\n"
"       are truncated (instead of rounded) to the requested precision.\n"
"       Similarly, on input an MGRS coordinate represents the center of the\n"
"       square (\"38n 444500 3688500\" in the example above).  However, if the -n\n"
"       option is given then the south-west corner of the square is returned\n"
"       instead (\"38n 444000 3688000\" in the example above).\n"
"\n"
"ZONE\n"
"       If the input is geographic, GeoConvert uses the standard rules of\n"
"       selecting UTM vs UPS and for assigning the UTM zone (with the Norway\n"
"       and Svalbard exceptions).  If the input is UTM/UPS or MGRS, then the\n"
"       choice between UTM and UPS and the UTM zone mirrors the input.  The -z\n"
"       zone, -s, and -t options allow these rules to be overridden with zone =\n"
"       0 being used to indicate UPS.  For example, the point\n"
"\n"
"          79.9S 6.1E\n"
"\n"
"       corresponds to possible MGRS coordinates\n"
"\n"
"          32CMS4324728161 (standard UTM zone = 32)\n"
"          31CEM6066227959 (neighboring UTM zone = 31)\n"
"            BBZ1945517770 (neighboring UPS zone)\n"
"\n"
"       then\n"
"\n"
"          echo 79.9S 6.1E      | GeoConvert -p -3 -m       => 32CMS4328\n"
"          echo 31CEM6066227959 | GeoConvert -p -3 -m       => 31CEM6027\n"
"          echo 31CEM6066227959 | GeoConvert -p -3 -m -s    => 32CMS4328\n"
"          echo 31CEM6066227959 | GeoConvert -p -3 -m -z 0  =>   BBZ1917\n"
"\n"
"       Is zone is specified with a hemisphere, then this is honored when\n"
"       printing UTM coordinates:\n"
"\n"
"          echo -1 3 | GeoConvert -u         => 31s 500000 9889470\n"
"          echo -1 3 | GeoConvert -u -z 31   => 31s 500000 9889470\n"
"          echo -1 3 | GeoConvert -u -z 31s  => 31s 500000 9889470\n"
"          echo -1 3 | GeoConvert -u -z 31n  => 31n 500000 -110530\n"
"\n"
"       NOTE: the letter in the zone specification for UTM is a hemisphere\n"
"       designator n or s and not an MGRS latitude band letter.  Convert the\n"
"       MGRS latitude band letter to a hemisphere as follows: replace C thru M\n"
"       by s (or south); replace N thru X by n (or north).\n"
