"DESCRIPTION\n"
"       Measure the area of a geodesic polygon.  Reads polygon vertices from\n"
"       standard input, one per line.  Vertices may be given as latitude and\n"
"       longitude, UTM/UPS, or MGRS coordinates, interpreted in the same way as\n"
"       GeoConvert(1).  (MGRS coordinates signify the center of the\n"
"       corresponding MGRS square.)  The end of input, a blank line, or a line\n"
"       which can't be interpreted as a vertex signals the end of one polygon\n"
"       and the start of the next.  For each polygon print a summary line with\n"
"       the number of points, the perimeter (in meters), and the area (in\n"
"       meters^2).\n"
"\n"
"       The edges of the polygon are given by the shortest geodesic between\n"
"       consecutive vertices.  In certain cases, there may be two or many such\n"
"       shortest geodesics, and in that case, the polygon is not uniquely\n"
"       specified by its vertices.  This only happens with very long edges (for\n"
"       the WGS84 ellipsoid, any edge shorter than 19970 km is uniquely\n"
"       specified by its end points).  In such cases, insert an additional\n"
"       vertex near the middle of the long edge to define the boundary of the\n"
"       polygon.\n"
"\n"
"       By default, polygons traversed in a counter-clockwise direction return\n"
"       a positive area and those traversed in a clockwise direction return a\n"
"       negative area.  This sign convention is reversed if the -r option is\n"
"       given.\n"
"\n"
"       Of course, encircling an area in the clockwise direction is equivalent\n"
"       to encircling the rest of the ellipsoid in the counter-clockwise\n"
"       direction.  The default interpretation used by Planimeter is the one\n"
"       that results in a smaller magnitude of area; i.e., the magnitude of the\n"
"       area is less than or equal to one half the total area of the ellipsoid.\n"
"       If the -s option is given, then the interpretation used is the one that\n"
"       results in a positive area; i.e., the area is positive and less than\n"
"       the total area of the ellipsoid.\n"
"\n"
"       Only simple (i.e., non-self-intersecting) polygons are supported for\n"
"       the area computation.  Polygons may include one or both poles.  There\n"
"       is no need to close the polygon.\n"
"\n"
"OPTIONS\n"
"       -r  toggle whether counter-clockwise traversal of the polygon returns a\n"
"           positive (the default) or negative result.\n"
"\n"
"       -s  toggle whether to return a signed result (the default) or not.\n"
"\n"
"       -l  toggle whether the vertices represent a polygon (the default) or a\n"
"           polyline.  For a polyline, the number of points and the length of\n"
"           the path joining them is returned; the path is not closed and the\n"
"           area is not reported.\n"
"\n"
"       -e a f\n"
"           specify the ellipsoid via the equatorial radius, a and the\n"
"           flattening, f.  Setting f = 0 results in a sphere.  Specify f < 0\n"
"           for a prolate ellipsoid.  A simple fraction, e.g., 1/297, is\n"
"           allowed for f.  By default, the WGS84 ellipsoid is used, a =\n"
"           6378137 m, f = 1/298.257223563.  If entering vertices as UTM/UPS or\n"
"           MGRS coordinates, use the default ellipsoid, since the conversion\n"
"           of these coordinates to latitude and longitude always uses the\n"
"           WGS84 parameters.\n"
"\n"
"       -w  toggle the longitude first flag (it starts off); if the flag is on,\n"
"           then when reading geographic coordinates, longitude precedes\n"
"           latitude (this can be overridden by a hemisphere designator, N, S,\n"
"           E, W).\n"
"\n"
"       -p prec\n"
"           set the output precision to prec (default 6); the perimeter is\n"
"           given (in meters) with prec digits after the decimal point; the\n"
"           area is given (in meters^2) with (prec - 5) digits after the\n"
"           decimal point.\n"
"\n"
"       -G  use the series formulation for the geodesics.  This is the default\n"
"           option and is recommended for terrestrial applications.  This\n"
"           option, -G, and the following three options, -E, -Q, and -R, are\n"
"           mutually exclusive.\n"
"\n"
"       -E  use \"exact\" algorithms (based on elliptic integrals) for the\n"
"           geodesic calculations.  These are more accurate than the (default)\n"
"           series expansions for |f| > 0.02.  (But note that the\n"
"           implementation of areas in GeodesicExact uses a high order series\n"
"           and this is only accurate for modest flattenings.)\n"
"\n"
"       -Q  perform the calculation on the authalic sphere.  The area\n"
"           calculation is accurate even if the flattening is large, provided\n"
"           the edges are sufficiently short.  The perimeter calculation is not\n"
"           accurate.\n"
"\n"
"       -R  The lines joining the vertices are rhumb lines instead of\n"
"           geodesics.\n"
"\n"
"       --comment-delimiter commentdelim\n"
"           set the comment delimiter to commentdelim (e.g., \"#\" or \"//\").  If\n"
"           set, the input lines will be scanned for this delimiter and, if\n"
"           found, the delimiter and the rest of the line will be removed prior\n"
"           to processing.  For a given polygon, the last such string found\n"
"           will be appended to the output line (separated by a space).\n"
"\n"
"       --version\n"
"           print version and exit.\n"
"\n"
"       -h  print usage and exit.\n"
"\n"
"       --help\n"
"           print full documentation and exit.\n"
"\n"
"       --input-file infile\n"
"           read input from the file infile instead of from standard input; a\n"
"           file name of \"-\" stands for standard input.\n"
"\n"
"       --input-string instring\n"
"           read input from the string instring instead of from standard input.\n"
"           All occurrences of the line separator character (default is a\n"
"           semicolon) in instring are converted to newlines before the reading\n"
"           begins.\n"
"\n"
"       --line-separator linesep\n"
"           set the line separator character to linesep.  By default this is a\n"
"           semicolon.\n"
"\n"
"       --output-file outfile\n"
"           write output to the file outfile instead of to standard output; a\n"
"           file name of \"-\" stands for standard output.\n"
