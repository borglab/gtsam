"\n"
"SYNOPSIS\n"
"       ConicProj ( -c | -a ) lat1 lat2 [ -l lon0 ] [ -k k1 ] [ -r ] [ -e a f ]\n"
"       [ -w ] [ -p prec ] [ --comment-delimiter commentdelim ] [ --version |\n"

"DESCRIPTION\n"
"       Perform one of two conic projections geodesics.  Convert geodetic\n"
"       coordinates to either Lambert conformal conic or Albers equal area\n"
"       coordinates.  The standard latitudes lat1 and lat2 are specified by\n"
"       that the -c option (for Lambert conformal conic) or the -a option (for\n"
"       Albers equal area).  At least one of these options must be given (the\n"
"       last one given is used).  Specify lat1 = lat2, to obtain the case with\n"
"       a single standard parallel.  The central meridian is given by lon0.\n"
"       The longitude of origin is given by the latitude of minimum (azimuthal)\n"
"       scale for Lambert conformal conic (Albers equal area).  The (azimuthal)\n"
"       scale on the standard parallels is k1.\n"
"\n"
"       Geodetic coordinates are provided on standard input as a set of lines\n"
"       containing (blank separated) latitude and longitude (decimal degrees or\n"
"       degrees, minutes, seconds);  for details on the allowed formats for\n"
"       latitude and longitude, see the \"GEOGRAPHIC COORDINATES\" section of\n"
"       GeoConvert(1).  For each set of geodetic coordinates, the corresponding\n"
"       projected easting, x, and northing, y, (meters) are printed on standard\n"
"       output together with the meridian convergence gamma (degrees) and\n"
"       (azimuthal) scale k.  For Albers equal area, the radial scale is 1/k.\n"
"       The meridian convergence is the bearing of the y axis measured\n"
"       clockwise from true north.\n"
"\n"
"       Special cases of the Lambert conformal projection are the Mercator\n"
"       projection (the standard latitudes equal and opposite) and the polar\n"
"       stereographic projection (both standard latitudes correspond to the\n"
"       same pole).  Special cases of the Albers equal area projection are the\n"
"       cylindrical equal area projection (the standard latitudes equal and\n"
"       opposite), the Lambert azimuthal equal area projection (both standard\n"
"       latitude corresponds to the same pole), and the Lambert equal area\n"
"       conic projection (one standard parallel is at a pole).\n"
"\n"
"OPTIONS\n"
"       -c lat1 lat2\n"
"           use the Lambert conformal conic projection with standard parallels\n"
"           lat1 and lat2.\n"
"\n"
"       -a lat1 lat2\n"
"           use the Albers equal area projection with standard parallels lat1\n"
"           and lat2.\n"
"\n"
"       -l lon0\n"
"           specify the longitude of origin lon0 (degrees, default 0).\n"
"\n"
"       -k k1\n"
"           specify the (azimuthal) scale k1 on the standard parallels (default\n"
"           1).\n"
"\n"
"       -r  perform the reverse projection.  x and y are given on standard\n"
"           input and each line of standard output gives latitude, longitude,\n"
"           gamma, and k.\n"
"\n"
"       -e a f\n"
"           specify the ellipsoid via the equatorial radius, a and the\n"
"           flattening, f.  Setting f = 0 results in a sphere.  Specify f < 0\n"
"           for a prolate ellipsoid.  A simple fraction, e.g., 1/297, is\n"
"           allowed for f.  By default, the WGS84 ellipsoid is used, a =\n"
"           6378137 m, f = 1/298.257223563.\n"
"\n"
"       -w  toggle the longitude first flag (it starts off); if the flag is on,\n"
"           then on input and output, longitude precedes latitude (except that,\n"
"           on input, this can be overridden by a hemisphere designator, N, S,\n"
"           E, W).\n"
"\n"
"       -p prec\n"
"           set the output precision to prec (default 6).  prec is the number\n"
"           of digits after the decimal point for lengths (in meters).  For\n"
"           latitudes and longitudes (in degrees), the number of digits after\n"
"           the decimal point is prec + 5.  For the convergence (in degrees)\n"
"           and scale, the number of digits after the decimal point is prec +\n"
"           6.\n"
"\n"
"       --comment-delimiter commentdelim\n"
"           set the comment delimiter to commentdelim (e.g., \"#\" or \"//\").  If\n"
"           set, the input lines will be scanned for this delimiter and, if\n"
"           found, the delimiter and the rest of the line will be removed prior\n"
"           to processing and subsequently appended to the output line\n"
"           (separated by a space).\n"
"\n"
"       --version\n"
"           print version and exit.\n"
"\n"
"       -h  print usage and exit.\n"
"\n"
"       --help\n"
"           print full documentation and exit.\n"
"\n"
"       --input-file infile\n"
"           read input from the file infile instead of from standard input; a\n"
"           file name of \"-\" stands for standard input.\n"
"\n"
"       --input-string instring\n"
"           read input from the string instring instead of from standard input.\n"
"           All occurrences of the line separator character (default is a\n"
"           semicolon) in instring are converted to newlines before the reading\n"
"           begins.\n"
"\n"
"       --line-separator linesep\n"
"           set the line separator character to linesep.  By default this is a\n"
"           semicolon.\n"
"\n"
"       --output-file outfile\n"
"           write output to the file outfile instead of to standard output; a\n"
"           file name of \"-\" stands for standard output.\n"
"\n"
"EXAMPLES\n"

"ERRORS\n"
"       An illegal line of input will print an error message to standard output\n"
"       beginning with \"ERROR:\" and causes ConicProj to return an exit code of\n"
"       1.  However, an error does not cause ConicProj to terminate; following\n"
"       lines will be converted.\n"
