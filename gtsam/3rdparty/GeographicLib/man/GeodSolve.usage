"DESCRIPTION\n"
"       The shortest path between two points on the ellipsoid at (lat1, lon1)\n"
"       and (lat2, lon2) is called the geodesic.  Its length is s12 and the\n"
"       geodesic from point 1 to point 2 has forward azimuths azi1 and azi2 at\n"
"       the two end points.\n"
"\n"
"       GeodSolve operates in one of three modes:\n"
"\n"
"       1.  By default, GeodSolve accepts lines on the standard input\n"
"           containing lat1 lon1 azi1 s12 and prints lat2 lon2 azi2 on standard\n"
"           output.  This is the direct geodesic calculation.\n"
"\n"
"       2.  With the -i command line argument, GeodSolve performs the inverse\n"
"           geodesic calculation.  It reads lines containing lat1 lon1 lat2\n"
"           lon2 and prints the corresponding values of azi1 azi2 s12.\n"
"\n"
"       3.  Command line arguments -L lat1 lon1 azi1 specify a geodesic line.\n"
"           GeodSolve then accepts a sequence of s12 values (one per line) on\n"
"           standard input and prints lat2 lon2 azi2 for each.  This generates\n"
"           a sequence of points on a single geodesic.  Command line arguments\n"
"           -D and -I work similarly with the geodesic line defined in terms of\n"
"           a direct or inverse geodesic calculation, respectively.\n"
"\n"
"OPTIONS\n"
"       -i  perform an inverse geodesic calculation (see 2 above).\n"
"\n"
"       -L lat1 lon1 azi1\n"
"           line mode (see 3 above); generate a sequence of points along the\n"
"           geodesic specified by lat1 lon1 azi1.  The -w flag can be used to\n"
"           swap the default order of the 2 geographic coordinates, provided\n"
"           that it appears before -L.  (-l is an alternative, deprecated,\n"
"           spelling of this flag.)\n"
"\n"
"       -D lat1 lon1 azi1 s13\n"
"           line mode (see 3 above); generate a sequence of points along the\n"
"           geodesic specified by lat1 lon1 azi1 s13.  The -w flag can be used\n"
"           to swap the default order of the 2 geographic coordinates, provided\n"
"           that it appears before -D.  Similarly, the -a flag can be used to\n"
"           change the interpretation of s13 to a13, provided that it appears\n"
"           before -D.\n"
"\n"
"       -I lat1 lon1 lat3 lon3\n"
"           line mode (see 3 above); generate a sequence of points along the\n"
"           geodesic specified by lat1 lon1 lat3 lon3.  The -w flag can be used\n"
"           to swap the default order of the 2 geographic coordinates, provided\n"
"           that it appears before -I.\n"
"\n"
"       -a  toggle the arc mode flag (it starts off); if this flag is on, then\n"
"           on input and output s12 is replaced by a12 the arc length (in\n"
"           degrees) on the auxiliary sphere.  See \"AUXILIARY SPHERE\".\n"
"\n"
"       -e a f\n"
"           specify the ellipsoid via the equatorial radius, a and the\n"
"           flattening, f.  Setting f = 0 results in a sphere.  Specify f < 0\n"
"           for a prolate ellipsoid.  A simple fraction, e.g., 1/297, is\n"
"           allowed for f.  By default, the WGS84 ellipsoid is used, a =\n"
"           6378137 m, f = 1/298.257223563.\n"
"\n"
"       -u  unroll the longitude.  Normally, on output longitudes are reduced\n"
"           to lie in [-180deg,180deg).  However with this option, the returned\n"
"           longitude lon2 is \"unrolled\" so that lon2 - lon1 indicates how\n"
"           often and in what sense the geodesic has encircled the earth.  Use\n"
"           the -f option, to get both longitudes printed.\n"
"\n"
"       -F  fractional mode.  This only has any effect with the -D and -I\n"
"           options (and is otherwise ignored).  The values read on standard\n"
"           input are interpreted as fractional distances to point 3, i.e., as\n"
"           s12/s13 instead of s12.  If arc mode is in effect, then the values\n"
"           denote fractional arc length, i.e., a12/a13.\n"
"\n"
"       -d  output angles as degrees, minutes, seconds instead of decimal\n"
"           degrees.\n"
"\n"
"       -:  like -d, except use : as a separator instead of the d, ', and \"\n"
"           delimiters.\n"
"\n"
"       -w  toggle the longitude first flag (it starts off); if the flag is on,\n"
"           then on input and output, longitude precedes latitude (except that,\n"
"           on input, this can be overridden by a hemisphere designator, N, S,\n"
"           E, W).\n"
"\n"
"       -b  report the back azimuth at point 2 instead of the forward azimuth.\n"
"\n"
"       -f  full output; each line of output consists of 12 quantities: lat1\n"
"           lon1 azi1 lat2 lon2 azi2 s12 a12 m12 M12 M21 S12.  a12 is described\n"
"           in \"AUXILIARY SPHERE\".  The four quantities m12, M12, M21, and S12\n"
"           are described in \"ADDITIONAL QUANTITIES\".\n"
"\n"
"       -p prec\n"
"           set the output precision to prec (default 3); prec is the precision\n"
"           relative to 1 m.  See \"PRECISION\".\n"
"\n"
"       -E  use \"exact\" algorithms (based on elliptic integrals) for the\n"

"           series expansions for |f| > 0.02.\n"
"\n"
"       --comment-delimiter commentdelim\n"
"           set the comment delimiter to commentdelim (e.g., \"#\" or \"//\").  If\n"
"           set, the input lines will be scanned for this delimiter and, if\n"
"           found, the delimiter and the rest of the line will be removed prior\n"
"           to processing and subsequently appended to the output line\n"
"           (separated by a space).\n"

"       --input-file infile\n"
"           read input from the file infile instead of from standard input; a\n"

"\n"

"\n"
"INPUT\n"
"       GeodSolve measures all angles in degrees and all lengths (s12) in\n"
"       meters, and all areas (S12) in meters^2.  On input angles (latitude,\n"
"       longitude, azimuth, arc length) can be as decimal degrees or degrees,\n"
"       minutes, seconds.  For example, \"40d30\", \"40d30'\", \"40:30\", \"40.5d\",\n"
"       and 40.5 are all equivalent.  By default, latitude precedes longitude\n"
"       for each point (the -w flag switches this convention); however on input\n"
"       either may be given first by appending (or prepending) N or S to the\n"
"       latitude and E or W to the longitude.  Azimuths are measured clockwise\n"
"       from north; however this may be overridden with E or W.\n"
"\n"
"       For details on the allowed formats for angles, see the \"GEOGRAPHIC\n"
"       COORDINATES\" section of GeoConvert(1).\n"
"\n"
"AUXILIARY SPHERE\n"
"       Geodesics on the ellipsoid can be transferred to the auxiliary sphere\n"
"       on which the distance is measured in terms of the arc length a12\n"
"       (measured in degrees) instead of s12.  In terms of a12, 180 degrees is\n"
"       the distance from one equator crossing to the next or from the minimum\n"
"       latitude to the maximum latitude.  Geodesics with a12 > 180 degrees do\n"
"       not correspond to shortest paths.  With the -a flag, s12 (on both input\n"
"       and output) is replaced by a12.  The -a flag does not affect the full\n"
"       output given by the -f flag (which always includes both s12 and a12).\n"
"\n"
"ADDITIONAL QUANTITIES\n"
"       The -f flag reports four additional quantities.\n"
"\n"
"       The reduced length of the geodesic, m12, is defined such that if the\n"
"       initial azimuth is perturbed by dazi1 (radians) then the second point\n"
"       is displaced by m12 dazi1 in the direction perpendicular to the\n"
"       geodesic.  m12 is given in meters.  On a curved surface the reduced\n"
"       length obeys a symmetry relation, m12 + m21 = 0.  On a flat surface, we\n"
"       have m12 = s12.\n"
"\n"
"       M12 and M21 are geodesic scales.  If two geodesics are parallel at\n"
"       point 1 and separated by a small distance dt, then they are separated\n"
"       by a distance M12 dt at point 2.  M21 is defined similarly (with the\n"
"       geodesics being parallel to one another at point 2).  M12 and M21 are\n"
"       dimensionless quantities.  On a flat surface, we have M12 = M21 = 1.\n"
"\n"
"       If points 1, 2, and 3 lie on a single geodesic, then the following\n"
"       addition rules hold:\n"
"\n"
"          s13 = s12 + s23,\n"
"          a13 = a12 + a23,\n"
"          S13 = S12 + S23,\n"
"          m13 = m12 M23 + m23 M21,\n"
"          M13 = M12 M23 - (1 - M12 M21) m23 / m12,\n"
"          M31 = M32 M21 - (1 - M23 M32) m12 / m23.\n"
"\n"
"       Finally, S12 is the area between the geodesic from point 1 to point 2\n"
"       and the equator; i.e., it is the area, measured counter-clockwise, of\n"
"       the geodesic quadrilateral with corners (lat1,lon1), (0,lon1),\n"
"       (0,lon2), and (lat2,lon2).  It is given in meters^2.\n"
"\n"
"PRECISION\n"
"       prec gives precision of the output with prec = 0 giving 1 m precision,\n"
"       prec = 3 giving 1 mm precision, etc.  prec is the number of digits\n"
"       after the decimal point for lengths.  For decimal degrees, the number\n"
"       of digits after the decimal point is prec + 5.  For DMS (degree,\n"
"       minute, seconds) output, the number of digits after the decimal point\n"
"       in the seconds component is prec + 1.  The minimum value of prec is 0\n"
"       and the maximum is 10.\n"
"\n"
"ERRORS\n"
"       An illegal line of input will print an error message to standard output\n"
"       beginning with \"ERROR:\" and causes GeodSolve to return an exit code of\n"
"       1.  However, an error does not cause GeodSolve to terminate; following\n"
"       lines will be converted.\n"
"\n"
"ACCURACY\n"
"       Using the (default) series solution, GeodSolve is accurate to about 15\n"
"       nm (15 nanometers) for the WGS84 ellipsoid.  The approximate maximum\n"
"       error (expressed as a distance) for an ellipsoid with the same\n"
"       equatorial radius as the WGS84 ellipsoid and different values of the\n"
"       flattening is\n"

"          0.2    300 mm\n"
"\n"
"       If -E is specified, GeodSolve is accurate to about 40 nm (40\n"

"MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS\n"
"       The shortest distance returned for the inverse problem is (obviously)\n"
"       uniquely defined.  However, in a few special cases there are multiple\n"
"       azimuths which yield the same shortest distance.  Here is a catalog of\n"
"       those cases:\n"
"\n"
"       lat1 = -lat2 (with neither point at a pole)\n"
"           If azi1 = azi2, the geodesic is unique.  Otherwise there are two\n"
"           geodesics and the second one is obtained by setting [azi1,azi2] =\n"
"           [azi2,azi1], [M12,M21] = [M21,M12], S12 = -S12.  (This occurs when\n"
"           the longitude difference is near +/-180 for oblate ellipsoids.)\n"
"\n"
"       lon2 = lon1 +/- 180 (with neither point at a pole)\n"
"           If azi1 = 0 or +/-180, the geodesic is unique.  Otherwise there are\n"
"           two geodesics and the second one is obtained by setting [azi1,azi2]\n"
"           = [-azi1,-azi2], S12 = -S12.  (This occurs when lat2 is near -lat1\n"
"           for prolate ellipsoids.)\n"
"\n"
"       Points 1 and 2 at opposite poles\n"
"           There are infinitely many geodesics which can be generated by\n"
"           setting [azi1,azi2] = [azi1,azi2] + [d,-d], for arbitrary d.  (For\n"
"           spheres, this prescription applies when points 1 and 2 are\n"
"           antipodal.)\n"
"\n"
"       s12 = 0 (coincident points)\n"
"           There are infinitely many geodesics which can be generated by\n"
