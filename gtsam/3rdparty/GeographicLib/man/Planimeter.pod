=head1 DESCRIPTION

Measure the area of a geodesic polygon.  Reads polygon vertices from
standard input, one per line.  Vertices may be given as latitude and
longitude, UTM/UPS, or MGRS coordinates, interpreted in the same way as
GeoConvert(1).  (MGRS coordinates signify the center of the
corresponding MGRS square.)  The end of input, a blank line, or a line
which can't be interpreted as a vertex signals the end of one polygon
and the start of the next.  For each polygon print a summary line with
the number of points, the perimeter (in meters), and the area (in
meters^2).

The edges of the polygon are given by the I<shortest> geodesic between
consecutive vertices.  In certain cases, there may be two or many such
shortest geodesics, and in that case, the polygon is not uniquely
specified by its vertices.  This only happens with very long edges (for
the WGS84 ellipsoid, any edge shorter than 19970 km is uniquely
specified by its end points).  In such cases, insert an additional
vertex near the middle of the long edge to define the boundary of the
polygon.

By default, polygons traversed in a counter-clockwise direction return a
positive area and those traversed in a clockwise direction return a
negative area.  This sign convention is reversed if the B<-r> option is
given.

Of course, encircling an area in the clockwise direction is equivalent
to encircling the rest of the ellipsoid in the counter-clockwise
direction.  The default interpretation used by B<Planimeter> is the one
that results in a smaller magnitude of area; i.e., the magnitude of the
area is less than or equal to one half the total area of the ellipsoid.
If the B<-s> option is given, then the interpretation used is the one
that results in a positive area; i.e., the area is positive and less
than the total area of the ellipsoid.

Only simple (i.e., non-self-intersecting) polygons are supported for the
area computation.  Polygons may include one or both poles.  There is no
need to close the polygon.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-r>

toggle whether counter-clockwise traversal of the polygon returns a
positive (the default) or negative result.

=item B<-s>

toggle whether to return a signed result (the default) or not.

=item B<-l>

toggle whether the vertices represent a polygon (the default) or a
polyline.  For a polyline, the number of points and the length of the
path joining them is returned; the path is not closed and the area is
not reported.

=item B<-e> I<a> I<f>

specify the ellipsoid via the equatorial radius, I<a> and
the flattening, I<f>.  Setting I<f> = 0 results in a sphere.  Specify
I<f> E<lt> 0 for a prolate ellipsoid.  A simple fraction, e.g., 1/297,
is allowed for I<f>.  By default, the WGS84 ellipsoid is used, I<a> =
6378137 m, I<f> = 1/298.257223563.  If entering vertices as UTM/UPS or
MGRS coordinates, use the default ellipsoid, since the conversion of
these coordinates to latitude and longitude always uses the WGS84
parameters.

=item B<-w>

toggle the longitude first flag (it starts off); if the flag is on, then
when reading geographic coordinates, longitude precedes latitude (this
can be overridden by a hemisphere designator, I<N>, I<S>, I<E>, I<W>).

=item B<-p> I<prec>

set the output precision to I<prec> (default 6); the perimeter is given
(in meters) with I<prec> digits after the decimal point; the area is
given (in meters^2) with (I<prec> - 5) digits after the decimal point.

=item B<-G>

use the series formulation for the geodesics.  This is the default
option and is recommended for terrestrial applications.  This option,
B<-G>, and the following three options, B<-E>, B<-Q>, and B<-R>, are
mutually exclusive.

=item B<-E>

use "exact" algorithms (based on elliptic integrals) for the geodesic
calculations.  These are more accurate than the (default) series
expansions for |I<f>| E<gt> 0.02.  (But note that the implementation of
areas in GeodesicExact uses a high order series and this is only
accurate for modest flattenings.)

=item B<-Q>

perform the calculation on the authalic sphere.  The area calculation is
accurate even if the flattening is large, I<provided> the edges are
sufficiently short.  The perimeter calculation is not accurate.

=item B<-R>

The lines joining the vertices are rhumb lines instead of geodesics.

=item B<--comment-delimiter> I<commentdelim>

set the comment delimiter to I<commentdelim> (e.g., "#" or "//").  If
set, the input lines will be scanned for this delimiter and, if found,
the delimiter and the rest of the line will be removed prior to
processing.  For a given polygon, the last such string found will be
appended to the output line (separated by a space).

=item B<--version>

print version and exit.

=item B<-h>

print usage and exit.

=item B<--help>

print full documentation and exit.

=item B<--input-file> I<infile>

read input from the file I<infile> instead of from standard input; a file
name of "-" stands for standard input.

=item B<--input-string> I<instring>

read input from the string I<instring> instead of from standard input.
All occurrences of the line separator character (default is a semicolon)
in I<instring> are converted to newlines before the reading begins.

=item B<--line-separator> I<linesep>

set the line separator character to I<linesep>.  By default this is a
semicolon.

=item B<--output-file> I<outfile>

write output to the file I<outfile> instead of to standard output; a
file name of "-" stands for standard output.

=head1 EXAMPLES

Example (the area of the 100km MGRS square 18SWK)

   Planimeter <<EOF
   18n 500000 4400000
   18n 600000 4400000
   18n 600000 4500000
   18n 500000 4500000
   EOF
   => 4 400139.53295860 10007388597.1913

The following code takes the output from gdalinfo and reports the area
covered by the data (assuming the edges of the image are geodesics).

   #! /bin/sh
   egrep '^((Upper|Lower) (Left|Right)|Center) ' |
   sed -e 's/d /d/g' -e "s/' /'/g" | tr -s '(),\r\t' ' ' | awk '{
       if ($1 $2 == "UpperLeft")
           ul = $6 " " $5;
       else if ($1 $2 == "LowerLeft")
           ll = $6 " " $5;
       else if ($1 $2 == "UpperRight")
           ur = $6 " " $5;
       else if ($1 $2 == "LowerRight")
           lr = $6 " " $5;
       else if ($1 == "Center") {
           printf "%s\n%s\n%s\n%s\n\n", ul, ll, lr, ur;
           ul = ll = ur = lr = "";
       }
   }
