For more information, see

    https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/

The current version of the library is 1.49.

Changes between 1.49 (released 2017-10-05) and 1.48 versions:

  * Add the Enhanced Magnetic Model 2017, emm2017. This is valid for
    2000 thru the end of 2021.

  * Avoid potential problems with the order of initializations in DMS,
    GARS, Geohash, Georef, MGRS, OSGB, SphericalEngine; this only would
    have been an issue if GeographicLib objects were instantiated
    globally. Now no GeographicLib initialization code should be run
    prior to the entry of main().

  * To support the previous fix, add an overload, Utility::lookup(const
    char* s, char c).

  * NearestNeighbor::Search throws an error if pts is the wrong size
    (instead of merely returning no results).

  * Use complex arithmetic for Clenshaw sums in TransverseMercator and
    tranmerc_{fwd,inv}.m.

  * Changes in cmake support:
    + fix compiler flags for GEOGRAPHICLIB_PRECISION = 4;
    + add CONVERT_WARNINGS_TO_ERRORS option (default OFF), if ON then
      compiler warnings are treated as errors.

  * Fix warnings about implicit conversions of doubles to bools in C++,
    C, and JavaScript packages.

  * Binary installers for Windows now use Visual Studio 14 2015.

Changes between 1.48 (released 2017-04-09) and 1.47 versions:

  * The "official" URL for GeographicLib is now
    https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io (instead of
    http://geographiclib.sourceforge.net).

  * The default range for longitude and azimuth is now (-180d, 180d],
    instead of [-180d, 180d).  This was already the case for the C++
    library; now the change has been made to the other implementations
    (C, Fortran, Java, JavaScript, Python, MATLAB, and Maxima).

  * Changes to NearestNeighbor:
    + fix BUG in reading a NearestNeighbor object from a stream which
      sometimes incorrectly caused a "Bad index" exception to be thrown;
    + add operator<<, operator>>, swap,
      std::swap(NearestNeighbor&, NearestNeighbor&);

  * Additions to the documentation:
    + add documentation on finding nearest neighbors;
    + normal gravity documentation is now on its own page and now has an
      illustrative figure;
    + document the truncation error in the series for auxiliary
      latitudes.

  * Fix BUGS in MATLAB function geodreckon with mixed scalar and array
    arguments.

  * Workaround bug in math.fmod for Python 2.7 on 32-bit Windows
    machines.

  * Changes in cmake support:
    + add USE_BOOST_FOR_EXAMPLES option (default OFF), if ON search for
      Boost libraries for building examples;
    + add APPLE_MULTIPLE_ARCHITECTURES option (default OFF), if ON build
      for both i386 and x86_64 on Mac OS X systems;
    + don't add flag for C++11 for g++ 6.0 (since it's not needed).

  * Fix compiler warnings with Visual Studio 2017 and for the C library.

Changes between 1.47 (released 2017-02-15) and 1.46 versions:

  * Add NearestNeighbor class.

  * Improve accuracy of area calculation (fixing a flaw introduced in
    version 1.46); fix applied in Geodesic, GeodesicExact, and the
    implementations in C, Fortran, Java, JavaScript, Python, MATLAB, and
    Maxima.

  * Generalize NormalGravity to allow oblate and prolate ellipsoids.  As
    a consequence a new form of constructor has been introduced and the
    old form is now deprecated (and because the signatures of the two
    constructors are similar, the compiler will warn about the use of
    the old one).

  * Changes in Math class:
    + Math::sincosd, Math::sind, Math::cosd only return -0 for the case
      sin(-0);
    + Math::atan2d and Math::AngNormalize return results in (-180deg,
      180deg]; this may affect the longitudes and azimuth returned by
      several other functions.

  * Add Utility::trim() and Utility::val<T>(); Utility::num<T>() is now
    DEPRECATED.

  * Changes in cmake support:
    + remove support of PACKAGE_PATH and INSTALL_PATH in cmake
      configuration;
    + fix to FindGeographicLib.cmake to make it work on Debian systems;
    + use $<TARGET_PDB_FILE:tgt> (cmake version >= 3.1);
    + use NAMESPACE for exported targets;
    + geographiclib-config.cmake exports GEOGRAPHICLIB_DATA,
      GEOGRAPHICLIB_PRECISION, and GeographicLib_HIGHPREC_LIBRARIES.

  * Add pkg-config support for cmake and autoconf builds.

  * Minor fixes:
    + fix the order of declarations in C library, incorporating the
      patches in version 1.46.1;
    + fix the packaging of the python library, incorporating the patches
      in version 1.46.3;
    + restrict junit dependency in the Java package to testing scope
      (thanks to Mick Killianey);
    + various behind-the-scenes fixes to EllipticFunction;
    + fix documentation and default install location for Windows binary
      installers;
    + fix clang compiler warnings in GeodesicExactC4 and
      TransverseMercator.

Changes between 1.46 (released 2016-02-15) and 1.45 versions:

  * The following BUGS have been fixed:
    + the -w flag to Planimeter(1) was being ignored;
    + in the Java package, the wrong longitude was being returned with
      direct geodesic calculation with a negative distance when starting
      point was at a pole (this bug was introduced in version 1.44);
    + in the JavaScript package, PolygonArea.TestEdge contained a
      misspelling of a variable name and other typos (problem found by
      threepointone).

  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES:
    + make the -w flag (to swap the default order of latitude and
      longitude) a toggle for all utility programs;
    + the -a option to GeodSolve(1) now toggles (instead of sets) arc
      mode;
    + swap order coslon and sinlon arguments in CircularEngine class.

  * Remove deprecated functionality:
    + remove gradient calculation from the Geoid class and GeoidEval(1)
      (this was inaccurate and of dubious utility);
    + remove reciprocal flattening functions, InverseFlattening in many
      classes and Constants::WGS84_r(); stop treating flattening > 1 as
      the reciprocal flattening in constructors;
    + remove DMS::Decode(string), DMS::DecodeFraction,
      EllipticFunction:m, EllipticFunction:m1, Math::extradigits,
      Math::AngNormalize2, PolygonArea::TestCompute;
    + stop treating LONG_NOWRAP as an alias for LONG_UNROLL in Geodesic
      (and related classes) and Rhumb;
    + stop treating full/schmidt as aliases for FULL/SCHMIDT in
      SphericalEngine (and related classes);
    + remove qmake project file src/GeographicLib.pro because QtCreator
      can handle cmake projects now;
    + remove deprecated Visual Studio 2005 project and solution files.

  * Changes to GeodesicLine and GeodesicLineExact classes; these changes
    (1) simplify the process of computing waypoints on a geodesic given
    two endpoints and (2) allow a GeodesicLine to be defined which is
    consistent with the solution of the inverse problem (in particular
    Geodesic::InverseLine the specification of south-going lines which
    pass the poles in a westerly direction by setting sin alpha_1 = -0):
    + the class stores the distance s13 and arc length a13 to a
      reference point 3; by default these quantities are NaNs;
    + GeodesicLine::SetDistance (and GeodesicLine::SetArc) specify the
      distance (and arc length) to point 3;
    + GeodesicLine::Distance (and GeodesicLine::Arc) return the distance
      (and arc length) to point 3;
    + new methods Geodesic::InverseLine and Geodesic::DirectLine return
      a GeodesicLine with the reference point 3 defined as point 2 of
      the corresponding geodesic calculation;
    + these changes are also included in the C, Java, JavaScript, and
      Python packages.

  * Other changes to the geodesic routines:
    + more accurate solution of the inverse problem when longitude
      difference is close to 180deg (also in C, Fortran, Java,
      JavaScript, Python, MATLAB, and Maxima packages);
    + more accurate calculation of lon2 in the inverse calculation with
      LONG_UNROLL (also in Java, JavaScript, Python packages).

  * Changes to GeodSolve(1) utility:
    + the -I and -D options now specify geodesic line calculation via
      the standard inverse or direct geodesic problems;
    + rename -l flag to -L to parallel the new -I and -D flags (-l is is
      retained for backward compatibility but is deprecated), and
      similarly for RhumbSolve(1);
    + the -F flag (in conjunction with the -I or -D flags) specifies
      that distances read on standard input are fractions of s13 or a13;
    + the -a option now toggles arc mode (noted above);
    + the -w option now toggles longitude first mode (noted above).

  * Changes to Math class:
    + Math::copysign added;
    + add overloaded version of Math::AngDiff which returns the error in
      the difference.  This allows a more accurate treatment of inverse
      geodesic problem when lon12 is close to 180deg;
    + Math::AngRound now converts tiny negative numbers to -0 (instead
      of +0), however -0 is still converted to +0.

  * Add -S and -T options to GeoConvert(1).

  * Add Sphinx documentation for Python package.

  * Samples of wrapping the C++ library, so it's accessible in other
    languages, are given in wrapper/C, wrapper/python, and
    wrapper/matlab.

  * Binary installers for Windows now use Visual Studio 12 2013.

  * Remove top-level pom.xml from release (it was specific to SRI).

  * A reminder: because of the JavaScript changes introduced in version
    1.45, you should remove the following installation directories from
    your system:
    + Windows: ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/doc/scripts
    + Others: ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/doc/GeographicLib/scripts

Changes between 1.45 (released 2015-09-30) and 1.44 versions:

  * Fix BUG in solution of inverse geodesic caused by misbehavior of
    some versions of Visual Studio on Windows (fmod(-0.0, 360.0) returns
    +0.0 instead of -0.0) and Octave (sind(-0.0) returns +0.0 instead of
    -0.0).  These bugs were exposed because max(-0.0, +0.0) returns -0.0
    for some languages.

  * Geodesic::Inverse now correctly returns NaNs if one of the latitudes
    is a NaN.

  * Changes to JavaScript package:
    + thanks to help from Yurij Mikhalevich, it is a now a node package
      that can be installed with npm;
    + make install now installs the node package in
      lib/node_modules/geographiclib;
    + add unit tests using mocha;
    + add documentation via JSDoc;
    + fix bug Geodesic.GenInverse (this bug, introduced in version 1.44,
      resulted in the wrong azimuth being reported for points at the
      pole).

  * Changes to Java package:
    + add implementation of ellipsoidal Gnomonic projection (courtesy of
      Sebastian Mattheis);
    + add unit tests using JUnit;
    + Math.toRadians and Math.toDegrees are used instead of
      GeoMath.degree (which is now removed), as a result...
    + Java version 1.2 (released 1998-12) or later is now required.

  * Changes to Python package:
    + add unit tests using the unittest framework;
    + fixed bug in normalization of the area.

  * Changes to MATLAB package:
    + fix array size mismatch in geoddistance by avoiding calls to
      subfunctions with zero-length arrays;
    + fix tranmerc_{fwd,inv} so that they work with arrays and mixed
      array/scalar arguments;
    + work around Octave problem which causes mgrs_fwd to return garbage
      with prec = 10 or 11;
    + add geographiclib_test.m to run a test suite.

  * Behavior of substituting 1/f for f if f > 1 is now deprecated.  This
    behavior has been removed from the JavaScript, C, and Python
    implementations (it was never documented).  Maxima, MATLAB, and
    Fortran implementations never included this behavior.

  * Other changes:
    + fix bug, introduced in version 1.42, in the C++ implementation to
      the computation of area which causes NaNs to be returned in the
      case of a sphere;
    + fixed bug, introduced in version 1.44, in the detection of C++11
      math functions in configure.ac;
    + throw error on non-convergence in Gnomonic::Reverse if
      GEOGRAPHICLIB_PRECISION > 3;
    + add geod_polygon_clear to C library;
    + turn illegal latitudes into NaNs for Fortran library;
    + add test suites for the C and Fortran libraries.

Changes between 1.44 (released 2015-08-14) and 1.43 versions:

  * Various changes to improve accuracy, e.g., by minimizing round-off
    errors:
    + Add Math::sincosd, Math::sind, Math::cosd which take their
      arguments in degrees.  These functions do exact range reduction
      and thus they obey exactly the elementary properties of the
      trigonometric functions, e.g., sin 9d = cos 81d
      = - sin 123456789d.
    + Math::AngNormalize now works for any angles, instead of angles in
      the range [-540d, 540d); the function Math::AngNormalize2 is now
      deprecated.
    + This means that there is now no restriction on longitudes and
      azimuths; any values can be used.
    + Improve the accuracy of Math::atan2d.
    + DMS::Decode avoids unnecessary round-off errors; thus 7:33:36 and
      7.56 result in identical values.  DMS::Encode rounds ties to even.
      These changes have also been made to DMS.js.
    + More accurate rounding in MGRS::Reverse and mgrs_inv.m; this
      change only makes a difference at sub-meter precisions.
    + With MGRS::Forward and mgrs_fwd.m, ensure that digits in lower
      precision results match those at higher precision; as a result,
      strings of trailing 9s are less likely to be generated.  This
      change only makes a difference at sub-meter precisions.
    + Replace the series for A2 in the Geodesic class with one with
      smaller truncation errors.
    + Geodesic::Inverse sets s12 to zero for coincident points at pole
      (instead of returning a tiny quantity).
    + Math::LatFix returns its argument if it is in [-90d, 90d]; if not,
      it returns NaN.
    + Using Math::LatFix, routines which don't check their arguments now
      interpret a latitude outside the legal range of [-90d, 90d] as a
      NaN; such routines will return NaNs instead of finite but
      incorrect results; caution: code that (dangerously) relied on the
      "reasonable" results being returned for values of the latitude
      outside the allowed range will now malfunction.

  * All the utility programs accept the -w option to swap the
    latitude-longitude order on input and output (and where appropriate
    on the command-line arguments).  CartConvert now accepts the -p
    option to set the precision; now all of the utilities except
    GeoidEval accept -p.

  * Add classes for GARS, the Global Area Reference System, and for
    Georef, the World Geographic Reference System.

  * Changes to DMS::Decode and DMS.js:
    + tighten up the rules:
      o 30:70.0 and 30:60 are illegal (minutes and second must be
        strictly less than 60), however
      o 30:60.0 and 30:60. are legal (floating point 60 is OK, since it
        might have been generated by rounding 59.99...);
    + generalize a+b concept, introduced in version 1.42, to any number
      of pieces; thus 8+0:40-0:0:10 is interpreted as 8:39:50.

  * Documentation fixes:
    + update man pages to refer to GeoConvert(1) on handling of
      geographic coordinates;
    + document limitations of the series used for TransverseMercator;
    + hide the documentation of the computation of the gradient of the
      geoid height (now deprecated) in the Geoid class;
    + warn about the possible misinterpretation of 7.0E+1 by
      DMS::Decode;
    + swaplatlong optional argument of DMS::DecodeLatLon and various
      functions in the GeoCoords class is now called longfirst;
    + require Doxygen 1.8.7 or later.

  * More systematic treatment of version numbers:
    + Python: __init__.py defines __version__ and __version_info__;
    + JavaScript:
      o Math.js defines Constants.version and Constants.version_string;
      o version number included as comment in packed script
        geographiclib.js;
      o geod-calc.html and geod-google.html report the version number;
      o https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/scripts/ gives access to
        earlier versions of geographiclib.js as geographiclib-m.nn.js;
    + Fortran: add geover subroutine to return version numbers;
    + Maxima: geodesic.mac defines geod_version;
    + CGI scripts: these report the version numbers of the utilities.

  * BUG FIXES:
    + NormalGravity now works properly for a sphere (omega = f = J2 =
      0), instead of returning NaNs (problem found by htallon);
    + CassiniSoldner::Forward and cassini_fwd.m now returns the correct
      azimuth for points at the pole.

  * MATLAB-specific fixes:
    + mgrs_fwd now treats treats prec > 11 as prec = 11;
    + illegal letter combinations are now correctly detected by
      mgrs_inv;
    + fixed bug where mgrs_inv returned the wrong results for prec = 0
      strings and center = 0;
    + mgrs_inv now decodes prec = 11 strings properly;
    + routines now return array results with the right shape;
    + routines now properly handle mixed scalar and array arguments.

  * Add Accumulator<T>::operator*=(T y).

  * Geohash uses "invalid" instead of "nan" when the latitude or
    longitude is a nan.

Changes between 1.43 (released 2015-05-23) and 1.42 versions:

  * Add the Enhanced Magnetic Model 2015, emm2015.  This is valid for
    2000 thru the end of 2019.  This required some changes in the
    MagneticModel and MagneticCircle classes; so this model cannot be
    used with versions of GeographicLib prior to 1.43.

  * Fix BLUNDER in PolarStereographic constructor introduced in version
    1.42.  This affected UTMUPS conversions for UPS which could be
    incorrect by up to 0.5 km.

  * Changes in the LONG_NOWRAP option (added in version 1.39) in the
    Geodesic and GeodesicLine classes:
    + The option is now called LONG_UNROLL (a less negative sounding
      term); the original name, LONG_NOWRAP, is retained for backwards
      compatibility.
    + There were two bad BUGS in the implementation of this capability:
      (a) it gave incorrect results for west-going geodesics; (b) the
      option was ignored if used directly via the GeodesicLine class.
      The first bug affected the implementations in all languages.  The
      second affected the implementation in C++ (GeodesicLine and
      GeodesicLineExact), JavaScript, Java, C, Python.  These bugs have
      now been FIXED.
    + The GeodSolve utility now accepts a -u option, which turns on the
      LONG_UNROLL treatment.  With this option lon1 is reported as
      entered and lon2 is given such that lon2 - lon1 indicates how
      often and in what sense the geodesic has encircled the earth.
      (This option also affects the value of longitude reported when an
      inverse calculation is run with the -f option.)
    + The inverse calculation with the JavaScript and python libraries
      similarly sets lon1 and lon2 in output dictionary respecting the
      LONG_UNROLL flag.
    + The online version of GeodSolve now offers an option to unroll the
      longitude.
    + To support these changes DMS::DecodeLatLon no longer reduces the
      longitude to the range [-180deg, 180deg) and Math::AngRound now
      coverts -0 to +0.

  * Add Math::polyval (also to C, Java, JavaScript, Fortran, python
    versions of the library; this is a built-in function for
    MATLAB/Octave).  This evaluates a polynomial using Horner's method.
    The Maxima-generated code fragments for the evaluation of series in
    the Geodesic, TransverseMercator, and Rhumb classes and MATLAB
    routines for great ellipses have been replaced by Maxima-generated
    arrays of polynomial coefficients which are used as input to
    Math::polyval.

  * Add MGRS::Check() to verify that a, f, k_UTM, and k_UPS are
    consistent with the assumptions in the UTMUPS and MGRS classes.
    This is invoked with GeoConvert --version.  (This function was added
    to document and check the assumptions used in the UTMUPS and MGRS
    classes in case they are extended to deal with ellipsoids other than
    WS84.)

  * MATLAB function mgrs_inv now takes an optional center argument and
    strips white space from both beginning and end of the string.

  * Minor internal changes:
    + GeodSolve sets the geodesic mask so that unnecessary calculations
      are avoided;
    + some routines have migrated into a math class for for python,
      Java, JavaScript libraries.

  * A reminder: because of changes in the installation directories for
    non-Windows systems introduced in version 1.42, you should remove
    the following directories from your system:
    + ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/cmake/GeographicLib*
    + ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/libexec/GeographicLib/matlab

Changes between 1.42 (released 2015-04-28) and 1.41 versions:

  * DMS::Decode allows a single addition or subtraction operation, e.g.,
    70W+0:0:15.  This affects the GeoCoords class and the utilities
    (which use the DMS class for reading coordinates).

  * Add Math::norm, Math::AngRound, Math::tand, Math::atan2d,
    Math::eatanhe, Math::taupf, Math::tauf, Math::fma and remove
    duplicated (but private) functionality from other classes.

  * On non-Windows systems, the cmake config-style find_package files
    are now installed under ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib${LIB_SUFFIX}
    instead of ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share, because the files are
    architecture-specific.  This change will let 32-bit and 64-bit
    versions coexist on the same machine (in lib and lib64).  You should
    remove the versions in the old "share" location.

  * MATLAB changes:
    + provide native MATLAB implementations for compiled interface
      functions;
    + the compiled MATLAB interface is now deprecated and so the
      MATLAB_COMPILER option in the cmake build has been removed;
    + reorganize directories, so that
      o matlab/geographiclib contains the native matlab code;
      o matlab/geographiclib-legacy contains wrapper functions to mimic
        the previous compiled functionality;
    + the installed MATLAB code mirrors this layout, but the parent
      installation directory on non-Windows systems is
      ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share (instead of
      ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/libexec), because the files are now
      architecture independent;
    + matlab/geographiclib is now packaged and distributed as MATLAB
      File Exchange package 50605 (this supersedes three earlier MATLAB
      packages);
    + point fix for geodarea.m to correct bug in area of polygons which
      encircle a pole multiple times (released as version 1.41.1 of
      MATLAB File Exchange package 39108, 2014-04-22).

  * artifactId for Java package changed from GeographicLib to
    GeographicLib-Java and the package is now deployed to Maven Central
    (thanks to Chris Bennight for help on this).

  * Fix autoconf mismatch of version numbers (which were inconsistent in
    versions 1.40 and 1.41).

  * Mark the computation of the gradient of the geoid height in the
    Geoid class and the <a href="GeoidEval.1.html">GeoidEval</a> utility
    as deprecated.

  * Work around the boost-quadmath bug with setprecision(0).

  * Deprecate use of Visual Studio 2005 "-vc8" project files in the
    windows directory.

Changes between 1.41 (released 2015-03-09) and 1.40 versions:

  * Fix bug in Rhumb::Inverse (with exact = true) and related functions
    which causes the wrong distance to be reported if one of the end
    points is at a pole.  Thanks to Thomas Murray for reporting this.

  * Add International Geomagnetic Reference Field (12th generation),
    which approximates the main magnetic field of the earth for the
    period 1900-2020.

  * Split information about Jacobi's conformal projection to a separate
    section and include more material.

Changes between 1.40 (released 2014-12-18) and 1.39 versions:

  * Add the World Magnetic Model 2015, wmm2015.  This is now the default
    magnetic model for MagneticField (replacing wmm2010 which is valid
    thru the end of 2014).

  * Geodesic::Inverse didn't return NaN if one of the longitudes was a
    NaN (bug introduced in version 1.25).  Fixed in the C++, Java,
    JavaScript, C, Fortran, and Python implementations of the geodesic
    routines.  This bug was not present in the Matlab version.

  * Fix bug in Utility::readarray and Utility::writearray which caused
    an exception in debug mode with zero-sized arrays.

  * Fix BLUNDER in OSGB::GridReference (found by kalderami) where the
    wrong result was returned if the easting or northing was negative.

  * OSGB::GridReference now returns "INVALID" if either coordinate is
    NaN.  Similarly a grid reference starting with "IN" results in NaNs
    for the coordinates.

  * Default constructor for GeoCoords corresponds to an undefined
    position (latitude and longitude = NaN), instead of the north pole.

  * Add an online version of RhumbSolve at
    https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/cgi-bin/RhumbSolve.

  * Additions to the documentation:
    + documentation on  Jacobi's conformal projection;
    + a page on Auxiliary latitudes (actually, this was added in
      version 1.39);
    + document the use of two single quotes to stand for a double quote
      in DMS (this feature was introduced in version 1.13).

  * The Matlab function, geographiclibinterface, which compiles the
    wrapper routines for Matlab now works with Matlab 2014b on a Mac.

Changes between 1.39 (released 2014-11-11) and 1.38 versions:

  * GeographicLib usually normalizes longitudes to the range [-180deg,
    180deg).  However, when solving the direct geodesic and rhumb line
    problems, it is sometimes necessary to know how many lines the line
    encircled the earth by returning the longitude "unwrapped".  So the
    following changes have been made:
    + add a LONG_NOWRAP flag to mask enums for the outmask arguments for
      Geodesic, GeodesicLine, Rhumb, and RhumbLine;
    + similar changes have been made to the Python, Javascript, and
      Java implementations of the geodesic routines;
    + for the C, Fortran, and Matlab implementations the arcmode
      argument to the routines was generalized to allow a combination of
      ARCMODE and LONG_NOWRAP bits;
    + the Maxima version now returns the longitude unwrapped.
    These changes were necessary to fix the PolygonAreaT::AddEdge (see
    the next item).

  * Changes in area calculations:
    + fix BUG in PolygonAreaT::AddEdge (also in C, Java, Javascript, and
      Python implementations) which sometimes causes the wrong area to
      be returned if the edge spanned more than 180deg;
    + add area calculation to the Rhumb and RhumbLine classes and the
      RhumbSolve utility;
    + add PolygonAreaRhumb typedef for PolygonAreaT<Rhumb>;
    + add -R option to Planimeter to use PolygonAreaRhumb (and -G option
      for the default geodesic polygon);
    + fix BLUNDER in area calculation in Matlab routine geodreckon;
    + add area calculation to Matlab/Octave routines for great ellipses.

  * Fix bad BUG in Geohash::Reverse; this was introduced in version 1.37
    and affected all platforms where unsigned longs are 32-bits.  Thanks
    to Christian Csar for reporting and diagnosing this.

  * Binary installers for Windows are now built with Visual Studio 11
    2012 (instead of Visual Studio 10 2010).  Compiled Matlab support
    still with version 2013a (64-bit).

  * Update GeographicLib.pro for builds with qmake to include all the
    source files.

  * Cmake updates:
    + include cross-compiling checks in cmake config file;
    + improve the way unsuitable versions are reported;
    + include_directories (${GeographicLib_INCLUDE_DIRS}) is no longer
      necessary with cmake 2.8.11 or later.

  * legacy/Fortran now includes drop-in replacements for the geodesic
    utilities from the NGS.

  * geographiclib-get-{geoids,gravity,magnetic} with no arguments now
    print the usage instead of loading the minimal sets.

  * Utility::date(const std::string&, int&, int&, int&) and hence the
    MagneticField utility accepts the string "now" as a legal time
    (meaning today).

Changes between 1.38 (released 2014-10-02) and 1.37 versions:

  * On MacOSX, the installed package is relocatable (for cmake version
     2.8.12 and later).

  * On Mac OSX, GeographicLib can be installed using homebrew.

  * In cmake builds under Windows, set the output directories so that
     binaries and shared libraries are together.

  * Accept the minus sign as a synonym for - in DMS.{cpp,js}.

  * The cmake configuration file geographiclib-depends.cmake has been
     renamed to geographiclib-targets.cmake.

  * Matlab/Octave routines for great ellipses added.

  * Provide man pages for geographiclib-get-{geoids,gravity,magnetic}.

Changes between 1.37 (released 2014-08-08) and 1.36 versions:

  * Add support for high precision arithmetic.

  * INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: the static instantiations of various classes
    for the WGS84 ellipsoid have been changed to a "construct on first
    use idiom".  This avoids a lot of wasteful initialization before the
    user's code starts.  Unfortunately it means that existing source
    code that relies on any of the following static variables will need
    to be changed to a function call:
    + AlbersEqualArea::AzimuthalEqualAreaNorth
    + AlbersEqualArea::AzimuthalEqualAreaSouth
    + AlbersEqualArea::CylindricalEqualArea
    + Ellipsoid::WGS84
    + Geocentric::WGS84
    + Geodesic::WGS84
    + GeodesicExact::WGS84
    + LambertConformalConic::Mercator
    + NormalGravity::GRS80
    + NormalGravity::WGS84
    + PolarStereographic::UPS
    + TransverseMercator::UTM
    + TransverseMercatorExact::UTM
    Thus, occurrences of, for example,
    const Geodesic& geod = Geodesic::WGS84; // version 1.36 and earlier
    need to be changed to
    const Geodesic& geod = Geodesic::WGS84(); // version 1.37 and later
    (note the parentheses!); alternatively use
    // works with all versions
    const Geodesic geod(Constants::WGS84_a(), Constants::WGS84_a());

  * Incompatible change: the environment variables
    {GEOID,GRAVITY,MAGNETIC}_{NAME,PATH} are now prefixed with
    GEOGRAPHICLIB_.

  * Incompatible change for Windows XP: retire the Windows XP common
    data path.  If you're still using Windows XP, then you might have to
    move the folder C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application
    Data\GeographicLib to C:\ProgramData\GeographicLib.

  * All macro names affecting the compilation now start with
    GEOGRAPHICLIB_; this applies to GEOID_DEFAULT_NAME,
    GRAVITY_DEFAULT_NAME, MAGNETIC_DEFAULT_NAME, PGM_PIXEL_WIDTH,
    HAVE_LONG_DOUBLE, STATIC_ASSERT, WORDS_BIGENDIAN.

  * Changes to PolygonArea:
    + introduce PolygonAreaT which takes a geodesic class as a
      parameter;
    + PolygonArea and PolygonAreaExact are typedef'ed to
      PolygonAreaT<Geodesic> and PolygonAreaT<GeodesicExact>;
    + add -E option to Planimeter to use PolygonAreaExact;
    + add -Q option to Planimeter to calculate the area on the authalic
      sphere.

  * Add -p option to Planimeter, ConicProj, GeodesicProj,
    TransverseMercatorProj.

  * Add Rhumb and RhumbLine classes and the RhumbSolve utility.

  * Minor changes to NormalGravity:
    + add J2ToFlattening and FlatteningToJ2;
    + use Newton's method to determine f from J2;
    + in constructor, allow omega = 0 (i.e., treat the spherical case).

  * Add grs80 GravityModel.

  * Make geographiclib-get-{geoids,gravity,magnetic} scripts work on
    MacOS.

  * Minor changes:
    + simplify cross-platform support for C++11 mathematical functions;
    + change way area coefficients are given in GeodesicExact to improve
      compile times;
    + enable searching the online documentation;
    + add macros GEOGRAPHICLIB_VERSION and GEOGRAPHICLIB_VERSION_NUM;
    + add solution and project files for Visual Studio Express 2010.

Changes between 1.36 (released 2014-05-13) and 1.35 versions:

  * Changes to comply with NGA's prohibition of the use of the
    upper-case letters N/S to designate the hemisphere when displaying
    UTM/UPS coordinates:
    + UTMUPS::DecodeZone allows north/south as hemisphere designators
      (in addition to n/s);
    + UTMUPS::EncodeZone now encodes the hemisphere in lower case (to
      distinguish this use from a grid zone designator);
    + UTMUPS::EncodeZone takes an optional parameter abbrev to
      indicate whether to use n/s or north/south as the hemisphere
      designator;
    + GeoCoords::UTMUPSRepresentation and AltUTMUPSRepresentation
      similarly accept the abbrev parameter;
    + GeoConvert uses the flags -a and -l to govern whether UTM/UPS
      output uses n/s (the -a flag) or north/south (the -l flag) to
      denote the hemisphere;
    + Fixed a bug what allowed +3N to be accepted as an alternation
      UTM zone designation (instead of 3N).
    WARNING: The use of lower case n/s for the hemisphere might cause
    compatibility problems.  However DecodeZone has always accepted
    either case; so the issue will only arise with other software
    reading the zone information.  To avoid possible misinterpretation
    of the zone designator, consider calling EncodeZone with abbrev =
    false and GeoConvert with -l, so that north/south are used to
    denote the hemisphere.

  * MGRS::Forward with prec = -1 will produce a grid zone designation.
    Similarly MGRS::Reverse will decode a grid zone designation (and
    return prec = -1).

  * Stop using the throw() declaration specification which is
    deprecated in C++11.

  * Add missing std:: qualifications to copy in LocalCartesion and
    Geocentric headers (bug found by Clemens).

Changes between 1.35 (released 2014-03-13) and 1.34 versions:

  * Fix blunder in UTMUPS::EncodeEPSG (found by Ben Adler).

  * Matlab wrapper routines geodesic{direct,inverse,line} switch to
    "exact" routes if |f| > 0.02.

  * GeodSolve.cgi allows ellipsoid to be set (and uses the -E option
    for GeodSolve).

  * Set title in HTML versions of man pages for the utility programs.

  * Changes in cmake support:
    + add _d to names of executables in debug mode of Visual Studio;
    + add support for Android (cmake-only), thanks to Pullan Yu;
    + check CPACK version numbers supplied on command line;
    + configured version of project-config.cmake.in is
      project-config.cmake (instead of geographiclib-config.cmake), to
      prevent find_package incorrectly using this file;
    + fix tests with multi-line output;
    + this release includes a file, pom.xml, which is used by an
      experimental build system (based on maven) at SRI.

Changes between 1.34 (released 2013-12-11) and 1.33 versions:

  * Many changes in cmake support:
    + minimum version of cmake needed increased to 2.8.4 (which was
      released in 2011-02);
    + allow building both shared and static librarys with
      -D GEOGRAPHICLIB_LIB_TYPE=BOTH;
    + both shared and static libraries (Release plus Debug) included in
      binary installer;
    + find_package uses COMPONENTS and GeographicLib_USE_STATIC_LIBS to
      select the library to use;
    + find_package version checking allows nmake and Visual Studio
      generators to interoperate on Windows;
    + find_package (GeographicLib ...) requires that GeographicLib be
      capitalized correctly;
    + on Unix/Linux, don't include the version number in directory for
      the cmake configuration files;
    + defaults for GEOGRAPHICLIB_DOCUMENTATION and
      BUILD_NETGEOGRAPHICLIB are now OFF;
    + the GEOGRAPHICLIB_EXAMPLES configuration parameter is no longer
      used; cmake always configures to build the examples, but they are
      not built by default (instead build targets: exampleprograms and
      netexamples);
    + matlab-all target renamed to matlabinterface;
    + the configuration parameters PACKAGE_PATH and INSTALL_PATH are
      now deprecated (use CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX instead);
    + on Linux, the installed package is relocatable;
    + on MacOSX, the installed utilities can find the shared library.

  * Use a more precise value for OSGB::CentralScale().

  * Add Arc routines to python interface.

  * The Geod utility has been removed; the same functionality lives on
    with GeodSolve (introduced in version 1.30).

Changes between 1.33 (released 2013-10-08) and 1.32 versions:

  * Add NETGeographic .NET wrapper library (courtesy of Scott Heiman).

  * Make inspector functions in GeographicLib::Ellipsoid const.

  * Add Accumulator.cpp to instantiate GeographicLib::Accumulator.

  * Generalize C interface for polygon areas to allow vertices to be
    specified incrementally.

  * Fix way flags for C++11 support are determined.

Changes between 1.31 (released 2013-07-01) and 1.30 versions:

  * Changes breaking binary compatibility (source compatibility is
    maintained):
    + overloaded versions of DMS::Encode,
      EllipticFunction::EllipticFunction, and
      GeoCoords::DMSRepresentation, have been eliminated by the use of
      optional arguments;
    + correct the declaration of first arg to UTMUPS::DecodeEPSG.

  * FIX BUG in GeographicLib::GravityCircle constructor (found by
    Mathieu Peyréga) which caused bogus results for the gravity
    disturbance and gravity anomaly vectors. (This only affected
    calculations using GravityCircle. GravityModel calculations did not
    suffer from this bug.)

  * Improvements to the build:
    + add macros GEOGRAPHICLIB_VERSION_{MAJOR,MINOR,PATCH} to Config.h;
    + fix documentation for new version of perlpod;
    + improving setting of runtime path for Unix-like systems with
      cmake;
    + install PDB files when compiling with Visual Studio to aid
      debugging;
    + Windows binary release now uses Matlab R2013a (64-bit) and uses
      the -largeArrayDims option.

  * Changes to the geodesic routines:
    + add Java implementation of the geodesic routines (thanks to Skip
      Breidbach for the maven support);
    + FIX BUG: avoid altering input args in Fortran implementation;
    + more systematic treatment of very short geodesic;
    + fixes to python port so that they work with version 3.x, in
      addition to 2.x (courtesy of Amato);
    + accumulate the perimeter and area of polygons via a double-wide
      accumulator in Fortran, C, and Matlab implementations (this is
      already included in the other implementations);
    + port PolygonArea::AddEdge and PolygonArea::TestEdge to JavaScript
      and python interfaces;
    + include documentation on short geodesics.

  * Unix scripts for downloading datasets,
    geographiclib-get-{geoids,gravity,magnetic}, skip already download
    models by default, unless the -f flag is given.

  * FIX BUGS: meridian convergence and scale returned by
    TransverseMercatorExact was wrong at a pole.

  * Improve efficiency of MGRS::Forward by avoiding the calculation of
    the latitude if possible (adapting an idea of Craig Rollins).

  * Fixes to the way the Matlab interface routines are built (thanks to
    Phil Miller and Chris F.).

Changes between 1.30 (released 2013-02-27) and 1.29 versions:

  * Changes to geodesic routines:

    + include polygon area routine in C and Fortran implementations;
    + add doxygen documentation for C and Fortran libraries.

Changes between 1.27 (released 2012-11-29) and 1.26 versions:

  * Changes to geodesic routines:
    + add native Matlab implementations: geoddistance.m, geodreckon.m,
      geodarea.m;

      solution is accurate to round off for |f| < 1/50;
    + tighten up the convergence criteria for solution of the inverse
      problem;
    + no longer signal failures of convergence with NaNs (a slightly
      less accurate answer is returned instead).

  * Fix DMS::Decode double rounding BUG.

  * On MacOSX platforms with the cmake configuration, universal
    binaries are built.

Changes between 1.26 (released 2012-10-22) and 1.25 versions:

  * Replace the series used for geodesic areas by one with better
    convergence (this only makes an appreciable difference if |f| >
    1/150).

Changes between 1.25 (released 2012-10-16) and 1.24 versions:

  * Changes to geodesic calculations:
    + restart Newton's method in Geodesic::Inverse when it goes awry;
    + back up Newton's method with the bisection method;
    + Geodesic::Inverse now converges for any value of f;
    + add GeodesicExact and GeodesicLineExact which are formulated in
      terms of elliptic integrals and thus yield accurate results
      even for very eccentric ellipsoids;
    + the -E option to Geod invokes these exact classes.

  * Add functionality to EllipticFunction:
    + add all the traditional elliptic integrals;
    + remove restrictions on argument range for incomplete elliptic
      integrals;
    + allow imaginary modulus for elliptic integrals and elliptic
      functions;
    + make interface to the symmetric elliptic integrals public.

  * Allow GeographicLib::Ellipsoid to be copied.

    + allow precision of reals to be set in cmake;
    + fail gracefully in the absence of pod documentation tools;
    + remove support for maintainer tasks in Makefile.mk;
    + upgrade to automake 1.11.6 to fix the "make distcheck" security
      vulnerability; see
      http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3386

Changes between 1.24 (released 2012-09-22) and 1.23 versions:

  * Allow the specification of the hemisphere in UTM coordinates in
    order to provide continuity across the equator:
    + add UTMUPS::Transfer;
    + add GeoCoords::UTMUPSRepresentation(bool, int) and
      GeoCoords::AltUTMUPSRepresentation(bool, int);

    + remove html documentation from distribution and use web links if
      doxygen is not available;
    + use doxygen tags to document exceptions;
    + begin migrating the documentation to using Greek letters where
      appropriate (requires doxygen 1.8.1.2 or later).

  * Add Math::AngNormalize and Math::AngNormalize2; the allowed range
    for longitudes and azimuths widened to [-540d, 540d).

  * DMS::Decode understands more unicode symbols.

  * Geohash uses geohash code "nan" to stand for not a number.

  * Add Ellipsoid::NormalCurvatureRadius.

  * Various fixes in LambertConformalConic, TransverseMercator,
    PolarStereographic, and Ellipsoid to handle reverse projections of
    points near infinity.

  * Fix programming blunder in LambertConformalConic::Forward (incorrect
    results were returned if the tangent latitude was negative).

Changes between 1.22 (released 2012-05-27) and 1.21 versions:

  * Add Geohash and Ellipsoid classes.

  * Fix bug in AlbersEqualArea of very prolate ellipsoids (b^2 > 2
    a^2).

  * cmake changes:
    + optionally use PACKAGE_PATH and INSTALL_PATH to determine
      CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX;
    + use COMMON_INSTALL_PATH to determine layout of installation
      directories;
    + as a consequence, the installation paths for the documentation,
      and python and matlab interfaces are shortened for Windows;
    + zip source distribution now uses DOS line endings;
    + the tests work in debug mode for Windows;
    + default setting of GEOGRAPHICLIB_DATA does not depend on

    + add a cmake configuration for build tree.

Changes between 1.21 (released 2012-04-25) and 1.20 versions:

  * Support colon-separated DMS output:
    + DMS::Encode and GeoCoords::DMSRepresentation generalized;
    + GeoConvert and Geod now accept a -: option.

  * GeoidEval does not print the gradient of the geoid height by default
    (because it's subject to large errors); give the -g option to get
    the gradient printed.

  * Work around optimization BUG in GeographicLib::Geodesic::Inverse
    with tdm mingw g++ version 4.6.1.

  * autoconf fixed to ensure that that out-of-sources builds work;
    document this as the preferred method of using autoconf.

  * Add --comment-delimiter and --line-separator options to the utility
    programs.

  * Add installer for 64-bit Windows; the compiled Matlab interface is
    supplied with the Windows 64-bit installer only.

Changes between 1.18 (released 2012-02-18) and 1.17 versions:

  * Improve documentation on configuration with cmake.

    for geoid, gravity, and magnetic data (instead of
    GEOGRAPHICLIB_GEOID_PATH, etc.); similarly, GeoidEval, Gravity, and
    MagneticField, look at the environment variable GEOGRAPHICLIB_DATA
    to locate the data.

  * Spherical harmonic software changes:
    + capitalize enums SphericalHarmonic::FULL and
      SphericalHarmonic::SCHMIDT (the lower case names are retained but
      deprecated);
    + optimize the sum by using a static table of square roots which is
      updated by SphericalEngine::RootTable;

      harmonic series.

  * Add Utility class to support I/O and date manipulation.

  * Cmake configuration includes a _d suffix on the library built in
    debug mode.

  * For the Python package, include manifest and readme files; don't
    install setup.py for non-Windows systems.

  * Include Doxygen tag file in distribution as doc/html/Geographic.tag.

Changes between 1.14 (released 2011-09-30) and 1.13 versions:

  * Ensure that geographiclib-config.cmake is relocatable.

  * Allow more unicode symbols to be used in DMS::Decode.

  * Modify GeoidEval so that it can be used to convert the height datum
    for LIDAR data.

  * Modest speed-up of Geodesic::Inverse.

  * Changes in python interface:
    + FIX BUG in transcription of Geodesic::Inverse;
    + include setup.py for easy installation;
    + python only distribution is available at
      http://pypi.python.org/pypi/geographiclib

  * Supply a minimal Qt qmake project file for library
    src/Geographic.pro.

Changes between 1.13 (released 2011-08-13) and 1.12 versions:

  * Changes to I/O:
    + allow : (colon) to be used as a DMS separator in DMS::Decode;
    + also accept Unicode symbols for degrees, minutes, and seconds
      (coded as UTF-8);
    + provide optional swaplatlong argument to various DMS and GeoCoords
      functions to make longitude precede latitude;
    + GeoConvert now has a -w option to make longitude precede latitude
      on input and output;
    + include a JavaScript version of DMS.

  * Slight improvement in starting guess for solution of geographic
    latitude in terms of conformal latitude in TransverseMercator,
    TransverseMercatorExact, and LambertConformalConic.

  * For most classes, get rid of const member variables so that the
    default copy assignment works.

  * Put Math and Accumulator in their own header files.

  * Remove unused "fast" GeographicLib::Accumulator method.

  * Reorganize the Python interface.

  * Withdraw some deprecated routines.

  * cmake changes:
    + include FindGeographic.cmake in distribution;
    + building with cmake creates and installs
      geographiclib-config.cmake;

Changes between 1.12 (released 2011-07-21) and 1.11 versions:

  * Change license to MIT/X11.

  * Add GeographicLib::PolygonArea class and equivalent Matlab function.

  * Provide JavaScript and Python implementations of geodesic routines.

  * Fix Windows installer to include runtime dlls for Matlab.

  * Fix (innocuous) unassigned variable in Geodesic::GenInverse.

    and the geodesic area.

  * FIX BUGS (compiler-specific) in inverse geodesic calculations.

  * FIX BUG: accommodate tellg() returning -1 at end of string.

  * Change way flattening of the ellipsoid is specified:
    + constructors take f argument which is taken to be the flattening
      if f < 1 and the inverse flattening otherwise (this is a
      compatible change for spheres and oblate ellipsoids, but it is an
      INCOMPATIBLE change for prolate ellipsoids);

      addition, simple fractions, e.g., 1/297, can be used for the
      flattening;
    + introduce Constants::WGS84_f() for the WGS84 flattening (and
      deprecate Constants::WGS84_r() for the inverse flattening);
