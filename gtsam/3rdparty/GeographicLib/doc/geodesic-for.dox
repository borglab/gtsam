\mainpage Geodesic routines implemented in Fortran
\author Charles F. F. Karney (charles@karney.com)
\version 1.49

The documentation for other versions is available at
<tt>https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/m.nn/Fortran</tt> for versions numbers
<tt>m.nn</tt> &ge; 1.28.

\section abstract-for Abstract

This is a Fortran implementation of the geodesic algorithms from <a
href="https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io">GeographicLib</a>.  This is a
self-contained library which makes it easy to do geodesic computations
for an ellipsoid of revolution in a Fortran program.  It is written in
Fortran 77 (avoiding features which are now deprecated) and should
compile correctly with just about any Fortran compiler.

\section download-for Downloading the source

The Fortran library is part of %GeographicLib which available for download at
- <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/geographiclib/files/distrib/GeographicLib-1.49.tar.gz">
  GeographicLib-1.49.tar.gz</a>
- <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/geographiclib/files/distrib/GeographicLib-1.49.zip">
  GeographicLib-1.49.zip</a>
.
as either a compressed tar file (tar.gz) or a zip file.  After unpacking
the source, the Fortran library can be found in the directory
<tt>legacy/Fortran</tt>.  The library consists of the file
geodesic.for.  The Fortran-90 interface is defined in geodesic.inc.

\section doc-for Library documentation

Here is the
\link geodesic.for <i>application programming interface</i>\endlink
for the library (this is just the documentation for the source file,
geodesic.for).

\section samples-for Sample programs

Also included are 3 small test programs:
 - geoddirect.for is a simple command line utility for solving the
   direct geodesic problem;
 - geodinverse.for is a simple command line utility for solving the
   inverse geodesic problem;
 - planimeter.for is a simple command line utility for computing the
   area of a geodesic polygon given its vertices.
 .
Here, for example, is geodinverse.for
\include geodinverse.for
To compile, link, and run this, you would typically use \verbatim
f95 -o geodinverse geodinverse.for geodesic.for
echo 30 0 29.5 179.5 | ./geodinverse \endverbatim
These sample programs can also be built with the supplied cmake file,
CMakeLists.txt, as follows \verbatim
mkdir BUILD
cd BUILD
cmake ..
make
make test
echo 30 0 29.5 179.5 | ./geodinverse \endverbatim

Finally, the two programs
 - ngsforward
 - ngsinverse
 .
which are also built with cmake, provide drop-in replacements for
replacements for the NGS tools FORWARD and INVERSE available from
http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PC_PROD/Inv_Fwd/.
These cure two problems of the Vincenty algorithms used by NGS:
 - the accuracy is "only" 0.1 mm;
 - the inverse program sometimes goes into an infinite loop.
 .
The corresponding source files
 - ngsforward.for
 - ngsinverse.for
 - ngscommon.for
 .
are derived from the NGS source files
 - forward.for, version 2.0, dated 2002-08-21
 - inverse.for, version 3.0, dated 2012-11-04
 .
and are therefore in the public domain.

\section library-for Using the library

- Optionally put @code{.for}
  include "geodesic.inc"
  @endcode
  in declaration section of your subroutines.
- make calls to the geodesic routines from your code.  The interface to
  the library is documented in geodesic.for.
- Compile and link as described above.

\section changes-for Change log

 - <a href="https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/1.49/Fortran">Version 1.49</a>
   (released 2017-10-05)
   - Fix code formatting and add two tests.

 - <a href="https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/1.48/Fortran">Version 1.48</a>
   (released 2017-04-09)
   - Change default range for longitude and azimuth to
     (&minus;180&deg;, 180&deg;] (instead of
     [&minus;180&deg;, 180&deg;)).

 - <a href="https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/1.47/Fortran">Version 1.47</a>
   (released 2017-02-15)
   - Improve accuracy of area calculation (fixing a flaw introduced in
     version 1.46).

 - <a href="https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/1.46/Fortran">Version 1.46</a>
   (released 2016-02-15)
   - More accurate inverse solution when longitude difference is close
     to 180&deg;.

 - <a href="https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/1.45/Fortran">Version 1.45</a>
   (released 2015-09-30)
   - The solution of the inverse problem now correctly returns NaNs if
     one of the latitudes is a NaN.
   - Include a test suite that can be run with "make test" after
     configuring with cmake.
   - The library now treats latitudes outside the range [&minus;90&deg;,
     90&deg;] as NaNs; so the sample programs no longer check for legal
     values of latitude.

 - <a href="https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/1.44/Fortran">Version 1.44</a>
   (released 2015-08-14)
   - Improve accuracy of calculations by evaluating trigonometric
     functions more carefully and replacing the series for the reduced
     length with one with a smaller truncation error.
   - The allowed ranges for longitudes and azimuths is now unlimited;
     it used to be [&minus;540&deg;, 540&deg;).
   - The sample programs, geoddirect and geodinverse, enforce the
     restriction of latitude to [&minus;90&deg;, 90&deg;].
   - The inverse calculation sets \e s12 to zero for coincident points
     at pole (instead of returning a tiny quantity).
