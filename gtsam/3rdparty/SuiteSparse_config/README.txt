SuiteSparse_config, 2018, Timothy A. Davis, http://www.suitesparse.com
(formerly the UFconfig package)

This directory contains a default SuiteSparse_config.mk file.  It tries to
detect your system (Linux, SunOS, or Mac), which compiler to use (icc or cc),
which BLAS and LAPACK library to use (OpenBLAS or MKL), and whether or not to
compile with CUDA.

For alternatives, see the comments in the SuiteSparse_config.mk file.

SuiteSparse_config directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SuiteSparse_config contains configuration settings for all many of the software
packages that I develop or co-author.  Note that older versions of some of
these packages do not require SuiteSparse_config.

  Package  Description
  -------  -----------
  AMD      approximate minimum degree ordering
  CAMD     constrained AMD
  COLAMD   column approximate minimum degree ordering
  CCOLAMD  constrained approximate minimum degree ordering
  UMFPACK  sparse LU factorization, with the BLAS
  CXSparse int/long/real/complex version of CSparse
  CHOLMOD  sparse Cholesky factorization, update/downdate
  KLU      sparse LU factorization, BLAS-free
  BTF      permutation to block triangular form
  LDL      concise sparse LDL'
  LPDASA   LP Dual Active Set Algorithm
  RBio     read/write files in Rutherford/Boeing format
  SPQR     sparse QR factorization (full name: SuiteSparseQR)

SuiteSparse_config is not required by these packages:

  CSparse       a Concise Sparse matrix package
  MATLAB_Tools  toolboxes for use in MATLAB
  GraphBLAS     graph algorithms in the language of linear algebra

In addition, the xerbla/ directory contains Fortan and C versions of the
BLAS/LAPACK xerbla routine, which is called when an invalid input is passed to
the BLAS or LAPACK.  The xerbla provided here does not print any message, so
the entire Fortran I/O library does not need to be linked into a C application.
Most versions of the BLAS contain xerbla, but those from K. Goto do not.  Use
this if you need too.

If you edit this directory (SuiteSparse_config.mk in particular) then you
must do "make purge ; make" in the parent directory to recompile all of
SuiteSparse.  Otherwise, the changes will not necessarily be applied.
