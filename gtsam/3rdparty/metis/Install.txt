These are some preliminary instructions for the 5.0 release of METIS.

1. You need to have a C compiler that supports the C99 standard. 
   Gcc works just fine, but I have not tested it on many other architectures
   (any feedback/patches for different architectures are welcomed)
   
2. You need to have GNU make and CMake 2.8 (http://www.cmake.org/) installed.

3. Edit the file include/metis.h and specify the width (32 or 64 bits) of the
   elementary data type used in METIS. This is controled by the IDXTYPEWIDTH
   constant.

   For now, on a 32 bit architecture you can only specify a width of 32, 
   whereas for a 64 bit architecture you can specify a width of either 
   32 or 64 bits.


4. At the top of Metis' directory execute 'make' and follow the instructions.
   
      make

5. To build on windows using Visual Studio follow the instructions in the
   file BUILD-Windows.txt.
